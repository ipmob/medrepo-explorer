## Can Periods Cause Constipation?

Yes, periods can cause constipation due to hormonal changes in the body.

Constipation is having fewer than three bowel movements per week or experiencing hard, painful stools.

During the menstrual cycle, your body undergoes fluctuations in hormone levels that can slow down digestion and affect bowel movements.

While constipation is a recognized menstrual-related digestive issue, it’s not the most common one.

One [study](https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6874-14-14) found that **28% of women experienced diarrhea** during menstruation, whereas **only 10% reported constipation**.

Moreover, the results of a 2020 survey, shown in the figure below, highlight the prevalence of various menstrual symptoms:

- **63% of women reported bloating**
- **37% experienced diarrhea**
- **32% experienced constipation**

As the figure shows, bloating and diarrhea are more commonly reported than constipation.

However, constipation can still occur and cause discomfort for some. Learning its causes and management ways can significantly improve comfort during menstruation.

## What Causes Constipation During Periods?

The main cause of constipation during periods is hormonal changes. However, other factors can make it worse. Here’s a closer look at the common causes:

### Hormonal Changes

- [**Progesterone**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/progesterone) **:** As your period approaches, progesterone levels rise. This hormone relaxes the muscles in your intestinal walls. When this happens, your gut works more slowly, which can cause stools to harden and become difficult to pass.
- [**Estrogen**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/estrogen) **:** During your cycle, rising estrogen levels can also affect how quickly food moves through your system. This often leads to slower digestion and more sluggish bowel movements.

Some believe that prostaglandins might also affect digestion and lead to constipation.

While [prostaglandins](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/prostaglandin) affect digestion by both [stimulating and inhibiting intestinal motility](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/582326#:~:text=Prostaglandins%20both%20stimulate%20and,glycogen%20metabolism%20in%20the%20liver.), current research does not strongly link them to constipation.

In fact, some theories suggest they may be more associated with diarrhea rather than constipation, but this still needs to be tested.

### Stress and Lifestyle Factors

- **Stress:** Stress during your period can slow digestion and increase the chance of constipation.
- **Lack of Physical Activity:** Many people reduce their activity levels during periods, and this can slow digestion and worsen constipation.

### Diet-Related Triggers

- **Low Fiber Intake:** A diet lacking in fiber or high in processed, fatty foods can lead to harder stools.
- **Dehydration:** Inadequate water intake during menstruation can dry out stools and worsen constipation.

### Underlying Health Conditions

- **IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome):** Women with IBS may have worse constipation during their period because of extra sensitivity and changing hormone levels.
- [**Endometriosis**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/endometriosis-explained) **:** [Studies](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4535676/#:~:text=Gastrointestinal%20symptoms%20among%20patients%20with%20endometriosis%20described%20in%20the%20literature,reported%20symptoms%20differ%20between%20studies.) suggest that endometriosis symptoms, including constipation, worsen during menstruation, likely due to increased inflammation and hormonal changes.

## How to Deal with Constipation During Periods

If constipation makes your period more uncomfortable, there are practical steps you can take to find relief and prevent future issues. Here’s what to do:

### Adjust Your Diet

Incorporate more fiber-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains into your meals. These foods help soften stools and improve digestion.

At the same time, reduce processed foods, salt, and sugar. These can worsen constipation by hardening stools and slowing digestion.

### Stay Hydrated

Drink plenty of water throughout the day to keep stools soft and easy to pass. If plain water feels dull, try warm lemon water for variety. Hydration helps with digestion and reduces bloating during periods.

### Exercise Regularly

Gentle physical activities, such as walking or yoga, can stimulate your intestines and bowel movements.

Even a short 20-minute session can help improve digestion and reduce constipation. If you’re feeling low on energy, simple stretches or light movement can still make a difference.

### Healthy Bathroom Tips

Listen to your body and don’t delay bathroom trips when you need to go. Waiting can make stools harder and more difficult to pass.

Changing your posture, like squatting or leaning forward, can also make bowel movements easier.

### Mild Laxatives

When constipation becomes too uncomfortable, mild laxatives can offer quick relief. It usually softens stools or encourages bowel movements.

It’s best to use them only sometimes and follow instructions, as overusing can make your body depend on them or upset its natural balance.

Always consider mild options and consult a healthcare provider if you’re unsure about which type to use.

### Natural Remedies

If you prefer a gentler solution, natural remedies can help improve digestion and promote regular bowel movements. These include:

- **Prune juice** for its natural laxative properties.
- **Warm lemon water** to support hydration and stimulate digestion.
- **Chia seeds** for their high fiber content, which helps improve stool consistency when soaked and added to meals.

These remedies are simple, effective, and easy to incorporate into your daily routine. These steps not only help relieve constipation but can also prevent it in future cycles

If constipation persists for more than a week or is accompanied by severe pain or blood in the stool, it’s important to see a doctor for further evaluation and treatment.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### \#\#\# Why do I feel the urge to poop during my period but can’t?

The hormonal changes during your period, particularly increased levels of progesterone, can slow down your digestive system. This can make it feel like you need to go but prevents your body from easily passing stools.

### \#\#\# How long does constipation from periods usually last?

Period-related constipation typically lasts a few days, starting before or during your cycle. Once hormone levels stabilize as your period progresses, digestion often returns to normal.

### \#\#\# Can constipation cause pain similar to period cramps?

Yes, constipation can feel like period cramps because the buildup of stool in your intestines can create pressure and discomfort in the lower abdomen, mimicking menstrual pain.
