### Common Gynecological Causes of Stabbing Pelvic Pain

### Ovarian Cysts

[Ovarian cysts](https://docus.ai/tags/ovarian-cysts) are fluid-filled sacs that develop on the ovaries. Many women don't notice them, but [large cysts](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/what-size-ovarian-cyst-dangerous), or when a cyst ruptures, it can cause sharp pelvic pain. According to [AAFP](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2011/0801/od1.html),  it occurs in **1 in 5 women**.

Symptoms may include bloating, discomfort in the lower abdomen, and pressure. If the pain is severe or you feel faint, it’s time to visit a doctor. Regular check-ups can help detect cysts early and avoid complications.

### Endometriosis

[Endometriosis](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/endometriosis-explained) happens when tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside of it. It can affect **10%** of women of reproductive age, as per [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/endometriosis).

This can lead to [painful periods](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/8-types-of-abnormal-menstruation), discomfort during sex, and even long-term fertility issues. If your menstrual cramps feel intense or last beyond your period, consider talking to your healthcare provider. Early treatment can help manage the pain and protect fertility.

### Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)

PID is an infection in the female reproductive organs, often caused by [sexually transmitted infections (STIs)](https://docus.ai/tags/sti). You might notice pelvic pain, unusual discharge, or pain during urination. Left untreated, PID can lead to serious complications like chronic pain or infertility.

If you have these symptoms, it’s crucial to see a doctor right away. Practicing safe sex and getting regular STI screenings can help prevent PID.

### Ectopic Pregnancy

An ectopic [pregnancy](https://docus.ai/tags/pregnancy) occurs when a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, usually in a fallopian tube. This condition can cause severe, stabbing pain on one side of the abdomen, along with [dizziness](https://docus.ai/tags/dizziness) or vaginal bleeding.

It’s a medical emergency that requires immediate attention to prevent life-threatening complications. If you suspect an ectopic pregnancy, go to the hospital immediately.

### Ovulation Pain (Mittelschmerz)

Ovulation pain, also called mittelschmerz, occurs around the middle of your [menstrual cycle](https://docus.ai/tags/menstruation). It’s usually a mild, brief pain on one side of the pelvis.

Though it’s harmless, staying hydrated and resting can ease discomfort. If the pain becomes persistent or severe, it may signal another condition, so consider consulting a doctor.

## Urinary System Causes

### Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)

A UTI is a common cause of pelvic pain, especially in women. About **25-40%** of women aged 20-40 in the United States have experienced one, as per [Medscape](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/256448-overview?form=fpf).

You may experience a burning sensation when urinating, frequent urges to go, or cloudy urine. Left untreated, a UTI can spread to the kidneys, causing a more serious infection. Drinking plenty of water and seeking treatment early can help prevent complications.

### Kidney Stones

Kidney stones can cause intense, sharp pain that starts in the back and moves to the lower abdomen or pelvis. The pain often comes in waves and can be accompanied by [nausea](https://docus.ai/tags/nausea).

If you think you have a kidney stone, staying hydrated is key. However, if the pain is severe or you have trouble passing urine, see a doctor immediately.

### Interstitial Cystitis

This condition, also known as painful bladder syndrome, can cause chronic pelvic pain and discomfort, especially during urination.

It’s not caused by an infection, but rather inflammation of the [bladder](https://docus.ai/tags/bladder). Managing interstitial cystitis may involve dietary changes, avoiding triggers like caffeine, and practicing stress-reducing activities such as yoga.

## Digestive System Causes

### Appendicitis

Appendicitis occurs when the appendix becomes inflamed and filled with pus. Symptoms start with a dull pain around the navel, which gradually shifts to sharp pain in the lower right abdomen.

Other symptoms include nausea, [vomiting](https://docus.ai/tags/vomiting), and [fever](https://docus.ai/tags/fever). This is a medical emergency that requires immediate surgical removal of the appendix to prevent rupture.

### Diverticulitis

Diverticulitis is the inflammation or infection of pouches (diverticula) that can form in the walls of the digestive tract. Symptoms include lower abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and changes in bowel habits.

Risk factors include **age**, a **low-fiber diet**, and **obesity**. If symptoms are severe or persistent, medical treatment is needed to avoid complications such as abscess formation or perforation.

## Immediate Actions to Take

- **Rest and Monitor Symptoms:** Lay down and avoid strenuous activities to reduce discomfort.
- **Hydrate and Use Heat Therapy:** Drink plenty of water and apply a heating pad to alleviate cramps or minor pain.
- **Check Symptoms Online**: Use a [Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker) to better understand potential causes before seeking medical care.
- **Contact a Doctor for Severe or Persistent Pain:** If the pain worsens, becomes unbearable, or is accompanied by other concerning symptoms like fever, dizziness, or vomiting, seek medical attention immediately.
