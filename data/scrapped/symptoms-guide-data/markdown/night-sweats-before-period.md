## What Are Night Sweats?

Night sweats refer to **excessive sweating during sleep**, which can drench your pajamas and bed sheets. Unlike regular sweating, which is typically caused by external factors such as a warm room or heavy blankets, night sweats **occur due to internal changes in your body**. This type of sweating can be intense, causing you to wake up feeling soaked and uncomfortable.

While occasional night sweats can be harmless and due to benign factors, persistent night sweats might indicate more serious health issues, such as hormonal imbalances, infections, or even certain types of cancer.

Identifying whether these episodes are related to hormonal fluctuations, infections, or other medical conditions is important for determining the appropriate course of action.

## Causes of Night Sweats Before Your Period

### Hormonal Fluctuations

Hormonal fluctuations are a primary cause of night sweats before your period. During the menstrual cycle, levels of **[estrogen](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/estrogen)** and **[progesterone](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/progesterone)** fluctuate significantly. After [ovulation](https://docus.ai/tags/ovulation), progesterone levels rise, leading to an increase in basal body temperature. As progesterone increases, estrogen levels decrease, which can affect the **hypothalamus**, the part of your brain responsible for regulating body temperature.

This hormonal shift can make you more sensitive to **temperature changes**, causing your body to overreact and produce night sweats. Many women experience these symptoms as part of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), a group of symptoms that occur before the onset of menstruation.

As women approach [perimenopause](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/perimenopause), the time leading up to [menopause](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/about-menopause), these fluctuations can become more pronounced, leading to more frequent and severe night sweats. According to the [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/menopause/features/menopause-sweating-11), up to **75%** of women experience hot flashes and night sweats during perimenopause.

### Endometriosis

[Endometriosis](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/endometriosis-explained) is a condition where the tissue similar to the lining inside the uterus grows outside it. This can cause significant hormonal imbalances, leading to symptoms such as night sweats before your period. The hormonal changes associated with endometriosis can trigger your body to react with excessive sweating during the night.

The [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/endometriosis/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwp4m0BhBAEiwAsdc4aOv5a2XGHmNeHb3XI3X1sJSfBWhv4S1klbjSi7Z6QU5hHl7SZYFlHxoCZ-gQAvD_BwE) estimates that approximately **10% (190 million)** of women and girls of reproductive age worldwide are affected by [endometriosis](https://docus.ai/tags/endometriosis).

In addition to night sweats, endometriosis can cause other symptoms such as:

- Severe menstrual cramps
- Chronic [pelvic pain](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/stabbing-pain-in-pelvic-area-in-females)
- Heavy menstrual bleeding

Recognizing these symptoms is important for early diagnosis and management. If you suspect endometriosis is causing your night sweats, consulting with a healthcare provider can help determine the appropriate treatment.

### Imbalanced Blood Sugar

Diet and blood sugar levels play a significant role in hormonal balance. Consuming high amounts of refined carbohydrates and sugary foods can cause spikes and drops in blood sugar levels, leading to **insulin resistance** over time.

Insulin resistance occurs when your body's cells become less responsive to [insulin](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/insulin), causing higher [levels of insulin](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/insulin#measuring-insulin-levels) and blood sugar.

This imbalance can affect the production of other hormones, including those involved in the menstrual cycle. High insulin levels can lead to increased [testosterone](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/testosterone) production, disrupting the balance of estrogen and progesterone. These hormonal disruptions can contribute to night sweats before your period.

Additional symptoms of imbalanced blood sugar include:

- [Acne](https://docus.ai/tags/acne)
- Weight gain
- Excess hair growth

Maintaining a balanced diet with low sugar intake can help manage these symptoms.

### Anxiety

[Anxiety](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/how-to-recognize-anxiety-in-yourself-and-others) is another common cause of night sweats before your period. When you're anxious, your body's " **fight or flight**" response is activated, which increases your heart rate and body temperature. This physiological response can lead to excessive sweating, including night sweats.

Managing anxiety can help reduce night sweats. Techniques such as deep breathing exercises, mindfulness, and regular physical activity can help calm your nervous system and reduce the frequency of anxiety-induced night sweats.

If anxiety is significantly affecting your life, seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor can provide additional strategies for management.

### Alcohol and Certain Medications

Alcohol can disrupt your body's natural ability to regulate its temperature, leading to both sweating and shivering. Some people are particularly sensitive to alcohol, and even moderate consumption can cause night sweats. To minimize this effect, try reducing or eliminating alcohol intake, especially in the hours leading up to bedtime.

Certain medications can also cause night sweats as a side effect. A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3931183/) from the NCBI found that up to **22%** of individuals taking selective **serotonin reuptake inhibitors** (SSRIs) antidepressants experience excessive sweating.

If you notice a correlation between your medication intake and night sweats, consult your healthcare provider. They might suggest adjusting the dosage or switching to an alternative medication. It's important to never stop or change your medication without professional guidance.

## How to Stop Night Sweats Before Period

### Lifestyle Changes

Managing night sweats before your period often starts with making some simple lifestyle changes. Creating a cooler sleeping environment is essential. Consider the following tips:

- **Adjust your room temperature:** Keep your bedroom cool by setting the thermostat lower, using fans, or keeping windows open if the weather permits.
- **Choose the right bedding:** Opt for lightweight, breathable materials such as cotton for your sheets and blankets. Avoid heavy comforters that can trap heat.
- **Wear lightweight sleepwear:** Choose moisture-wicking fabrics to help keep you dry and comfortable throughout the night.

Regular exercise plays a crucial role in overall health and can help manage night sweats. However, it's important to avoid heavy workouts right before bedtime, as this can raise your body temperature and make sweating worse. Aim to exercise earlier in the day.

Avoiding common triggers can also reduce the frequency of night sweats. These triggers include:

- **Spicy foods:** Consuming spicy foods close to bedtime can increase body temperature and trigger sweating.
- **Alcohol:** Alcohol can disrupt your body’s ability to regulate temperature, leading to night sweats.
- **Caffeine:** Caffeine can stimulate the nervous system and increase sweating, so try to limit its intake, especially in the evening.

### Home Remedies

In addition to lifestyle changes, several home remedies can help manage night sweats:

- **Breathable bedding:** Use sheets and pillowcases made from natural fibers like cotton or linen, which allow for better airflow and help keep you cool.
- **Cold packs:** Place a cold pack under your pillow before bedtime. When you wake up feeling hot, flip the pillow to the cool side for instant relief.
- **Hydration:** Keep a glass of cold water by your bed. Sipping water can help cool you down if you wake up sweating.

These simple adjustments can make a significant difference in your comfort during the night.

### Alternative Treatments

For those seeking additional ways to manage night sweats, alternative treatments might be worth considering. Some people find relief through natural remedies and supplements. Popular options include:

- **Herbal supplements:** Certain herbs, such as black cohosh and evening primrose oil, are believed to help balance hormones and reduce night sweats.
- **Yoga and meditation:** Practicing relaxation techniques can help reduce stress and anxiety, which may, in turn, decrease night sweats.
- **Supplements:** Some people use dietary supplements like magnesium, vitamin E, and omega-3 fatty acids, which may help regulate body temperature and reduce the severity of night sweats.

Before starting any new supplement or treatment, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare provider. They can ensure that the treatment is safe and appropriate for your specific situation and can help you avoid potential interactions with other medications you might be taking.

## When to See a Healthcare Provider

While night sweats can be a common symptom of hormonal changes before your period, there are times when you should seek medical advice.

Persistent night sweats, especially when accompanied by other symptoms, may indicate an underlying health issue. Consult your healthcare provider if you experience:

- Fever
- Unexplained weight loss
- Unexplained rash
- Swollen lymph nodes
- Trouble getting a good night’s sleep
- Changes in appetite

These symptoms could signal more serious conditions such as infections, autoimmune disorders, or even cancers like [lymphoma](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/lymphoma).

Addressing persistent night sweats and related symptoms promptly is important for ruling out any serious underlying conditions. Your healthcare provider can help determine the cause of your symptoms and recommend appropriate treatments or lifestyle changes.
