## The Relationship Between Coughing and Stomach Pain

Coughing involves a sudden, forceful exhalation, which engages not only the muscles of the chest and diaphragm but also those in the [abdominal](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/understanding-causes-of-lower-abdomen-pain) region. When you cough, your abdominal muscles contract to help expel air from the lungs.

Repeated or severe coughing can strain these muscles, leading to soreness and pain. This is particularly noticeable after long bouts of coughing, such as those caused by respiratory infections or chronic respiratory conditions.

## What Causes Stomach Pain When You Cough?

This discomfort may alarm you, but understanding why it happens is the first step toward managing or preventing it. To properly [manage pain when coughing](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/managing-body-pain-when-coughing), it's crucial to understand the underlying cause of the discomfort.
