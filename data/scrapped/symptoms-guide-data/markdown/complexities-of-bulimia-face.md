## What is Bulimia Face?

"Bulimia face," sometimes called **"bulimia cheeks"** or **"chipmunk cheeks,"** refers to the noticeable swelling of the cheeks caused by frequent [**self-induced vomiting**](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/safe-ways-to-induce-vomiting), a common behavior in individuals suffering from **bulimia nervosa**. This swelling primarily results from the enlargement of the **parotid glands**, which are located near the ears and along the jawline.

According to [Gitnux](https://gitnux.org/bulimic-statistics/), **1.5% of women in the U.S.** suffer from bulimia at some point in their lives. The visible effects on the face can cause distress and embarrassment, adding to the emotional and psychological toll of this eating disorder.

## What Causes ‘Bulimia Face’?

The swelling often associated with **"bulimia face"** is primarily due to inflammation of the **salivary glands**, particularly the parotid glands. The inflammation occurs due to:

- **Frequent** [**Vomiting**](https://docus.ai/tags/vomiting): Chronic vomiting leads to irritation and overstimulation of the salivary glands, causing them to swell.
- [**Hydration**](https://docus.ai/tags/hydration) **and Chemical Imbalance**: Vomiting disrupts the body’s **electrolyte balance**, contributing to gland swelling.
- **Physical Trauma**: Repeated vomiting may lead to direct trauma to the glands and surrounding tissues.

## How Can You Identify Bulimia Nervosa?

### Emotional Symptoms

- Obsession with body image and weight.
- Intense fear of weight gain.
- Guilt and shame after eating.
- [**Anxiety**](https://docus.ai/tags/anxiety) **and depression**, especially around food.

### Physical Symptoms

- Noticeable fluctuations in weight.
- Swollen cheeks (bulimia face).
- Dental issues such as enamel erosion.
- Unexplained gastrointestinal problems.

When these emotional and physical signs are present, the noticeable swelling of the cheeks may be a result of the frequent vomiting associated with bulimia nervosa.

## How to Get Rid of 'Bulimia Face'?

Reducing bulimia face, or the swelling caused by frequent vomiting, primarily involves addressing the root cause—bulimia nervosa itself. However, there are several approaches that can help reduce the swelling and restore a healthier appearance:

### 1\. Stop Purging Behaviors

The first and most essential step to reducing bulimia face is to cease the behaviors that cause the swelling, particularly **self-induced vomiting**. When purging stops, the **salivary glands** will gradually return to their normal size, often within a few weeks.

### 2\. Stay Hydrated

**Dehydration** worsens the swelling of salivary glands, so it’s essential to drink plenty of water. This helps balance your body’s **electrolyte levels**, reducing inflammation and promoting healthy circulation.

### 3\. Massage the Swollen Area

Gentle, circular **massages** around the jawline and cheek area can help stimulate drainage and reduce gland swelling. Doing this for about **10 minutes daily** can improve blood flow and reduce the discomfort associated with swollen cheeks.

### 4\. Apply Warm Compresses

Applying a **warm compress** to the affected area increases circulation and helps reduce swelling. Try using a warm, damp cloth for **10–15 minutes** several times a day to soothe the area.

### 5\. Eat Anti-Inflammatory Foods

Adding **anti-inflammatory foods** to your diet can help reduce overall swelling. Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids (like salmon, flaxseeds, and walnuts), leafy greens, and berries may help control the inflammation caused by chronic vomiting.

### 6\. Seek Medical and Nutritional Treatment

**Professional treatment** is crucial for addressing both the symptoms of bulimia face and the underlying eating disorder. Working with a **nutritionist** to restore a balanced diet, along with **psychotherapy** (such as **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy**), can help you stop purging and restore normal body functions.

### 7\. Consider Over-the-Counter Solutions

Over-the-counter medications, such as **non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**, can reduce inflammation and provide relief. However, it’s essential to consult with a healthcare provider before using medications as part of your treatment.

### 8\. Give It Time

Once purging stops, the swelling will typically subside within **a few weeks**. The length of recovery may vary depending on the frequency of vomiting and the duration of the behavior. Be patient with the process, as facial swelling can take time to reduce fully.

## Additional Resources and Support Networks

Letting someone know they’re not alone and that recovery is possible can be incredibly empowering. Additionally, here are some valuable resources for further support:

- [ANAD Helpline](https://anad.org/get-help/eating-disorders-helpline/): Provides direct support and referrals for those struggling with eating disorders.
