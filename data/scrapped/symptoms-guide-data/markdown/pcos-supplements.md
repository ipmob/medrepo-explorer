## What is PCOS?

[Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/pcos-overview) is a common hormonal disorder affecting **8-13%** of women of reproductive age, states [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/polycystic-ovary-syndrome?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwhb60BhClARIsABGGtw_V3V8vuBEpp71bxsITLhebDnbTNr1Mw46GsGVyt8s0P8imu0uoYY8aAgI8EALw_wcB). It is characterized by an excess of androgens, leading to symptoms like insulin resistance, [irregular menstrual cycles](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/8-types-of-abnormal-menstruation), [acne](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/pcos-acne), and weight gain.

Women with PCOS often have irregular periods or no menstruation due to lack of ovulation. Insulin resistance is prevalent, causing **higher blood sugar levels** and contributing to **weight gain**. Other symptoms include excessive hair growth on the face and body, thinning scalp hair, and persistent acne.

Long-term health risks associated with PCOS include a higher likelihood of developing **type 2 [diabetes](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/diabetes)**, **cardiovascular diseases**, and **metabolic syndrome**. Infertility due to ovulatory dysfunction and mental health issues like depression and anxiety are also common. Managing PCOS effectively through lifestyle changes, medical interventions, and potentially supplements is crucial to mitigate these risks.

## Why Consider Supplements for PCOS?

Supplements offer natural support for managing PCOS symptoms. They can help address hormonal imbalances, improve insulin sensitivity, and reduce inflammation. Supplements like **inositol**, **vitamin D**, and **omega-3 fatty acids** have shown promise in managing symptoms and improving overall health in women with PCOS.

**It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any supplement regimen**. A doctor can provide personalized advice based on individual health needs and ensure that the supplements won't interfere with any existing medications or conditions. By combining supplements with lifestyle changes, such as a balanced diet and regular exercise, women with PCOS can better manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life.

## Top 9 PCOS Supplements and Vitamins

### Inositol

Inositol, specifically myo-inositol and d-chiro-inositol, is a **type of vitamin B8** that plays a vital role in managing PCOS. These forms of inositol help improve insulin sensitivity, which is crucial for women with PCOS. They can also regulate menstrual cycles, and enhance fertility.

Inositol is available separately or as a part of multivitamins, which can also strengthen the immune system, and enhance rest, memory, heart health, and reduce anxiety.

#### Scientific Evidence and Benefits

[Research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377527798_Update_on_the_combination_of_myo-inositold-chiro-inositol_for_the_treatment_of_polycystic_ovary_syndrome) from Gynecological Endocrinology has shown that inositol can lower [insulin levels](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/insulin#measuring-insulin-levels) and improve blood sugar control. Studies indicate that women taking myo-inositol have better ovulatory function and higher pregnancy rates. Combining **myo-inositol and d-chiro-inositol in a 40:1** ratio enhances insulin sensitivity and reduces androgen levels, helping with symptoms like acne and excessive hair growth.

#### Alternative Sources

- **Fruits**: Oranges, grapefruits, lemons, bananas, cantaloupes
- **Vegetables**: Spinach, kale, beans, lentils, peas, Brussels sprouts
- **Nuts and Seeds**: Almonds, walnuts, sesame seeds
- **Whole Grains**: Brown rice, oats, whole wheat
- **Animal Products**: Liver, eggs

### Vitamin D

Up to **85%** of women with PCOS have low levels of vitamin D, as [noted](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4669857/#:~:text=The%20prevalence%20of%20vitamin%20D,%3C20%20ng%2Fml3.) in the Indian Journal of Medical Research. Vitamin D supports menstrual regularity, improves fertility, and boosts mood. Supplementation can enhance insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of [diabetes](https://docus.ai/tags/diabetes). Vitamin D also plays a crucial role in pregnancy health.

#### Alternative Sources

- **Sunlight**: Exposure to sunlight enables the body to produce Vitamin D.
- **Fatty Fish**: Salmon, mackerel, sardines, and tuna.
- **Egg Yolks**: Contain small amounts of Vitamin D.

### Curcumin

Curcumin, found in turmeric, is known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It helps regulate inflammation, which is often high in PCOS, reduce insulin resistance, and regulate androgen levels.

#### Scientific Evidence and Benefits

[Studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32220355/) from Clinical Nutrition ESPEN show that curcumin can improve insulin resistance and lower androgen levels. It also helps with ovulation and reduces symptoms like acne.

#### Alternative Sources

- **Foods**: Turmeric spice added to dishes like curries, soups, and smoothies.
- **Drinks**: Turmeric tea or golden milk.

#### Scientific Evidence and Benefits

Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5870911/) indicates that omega-3 supplements can lower insulin resistance and triglyceride levels. They also improve mood and mental health, which are often affected by PCOS.

- **Algal Oil**: Derived from algae, a plant-based source of DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid).

### CoQ10

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an antioxidant that helps with energy production, and metabolic and inflammatory issues related to PCOS. It improves blood sugar control, lowers [cholesterol levels](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/cholesterol#cholesterol-levels-by-age-and-sex), and enhances fertility.

#### Scientific Evidence and Benefits

Journal of Diabetes & Metabolic Disorders [noted](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4583053/) in the study that CoQ10 can improve blood sugar control, lower cholesterol levels, and enhance fertility.

#### Alternative Sources

- **Foods**: Organ meats (liver, heart), fatty fish (trout, sardines), spinach, broccoli, and cauliflower.

### Berberine

Berberine is known for improving insulin resistance and metabolic health. It has shown similar efficacy to metformin, making it a popular natural alternative. Berberine can lower blood sugar levels and improve lipid profiles, aiding in the overall management of PCOS symptoms.

#### Alternative Sources

- **Natural sources**: Goldenseal, barberry, Oregon grape, and tree turmeric.

### Magnesium

Magnesium is vital for glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. It helps reduce insulin resistance, making it crucial for managing PCOS. Magnesium supplements should be in forms like magnesium glycinate or citrate for better absorption.

To avoid the hassle of taking them separately, find these vitamins in Complete Multivitamin.

#### Scientific Evidence and Benefits

[Vitamin B12](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/vitamin-b12) is crucial for those taking metformin, and it can lower B12 levels. B6 and folate support energy levels and hormonal balance, notes [Gov.UK](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/metformin-and-reduced-vitamin-b12-levels-new-advice-for-monitoring-patients-at-risk).
