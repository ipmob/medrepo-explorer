## What Is Vitamin B12 Deficiency?

[Vitamin B12](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/vitamin-b12), also known as **cobalamin**, is a key nutrient your body needs to stay healthy.

It helps **produce energy**, **makes** [**red blood cells**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/red-blood-cell-rbc), and keeps your **nervous system working properly**. Vitamin B12 also plays a key role in **DNA synthesis**, which is essential for cell growth and repair.

Without enough vitamin B12, your body can’t function as it should.

When your vitamin B12 levels drop too low (less than **[160 pg/mL](https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/tests/vitamin-b12-level#:~:text=Normal%20values%20are%20160%20to,your%20specific%20test%20results%20mean.)**), it’s called a **deficiency**. This can cause a range of symptoms, such as:

- Feeling tired all the time.
- Tingling or numbness in your hands and feet.
- Pale or yellowish skin.
- Trouble thinking clearly or remembering things.

A vitamin B12 deficiency often develops slowly. Over time, the symptoms may worsen if not treated. For example, you might feel unusually weak or notice changes in your balance.

It’s crucial to distinguish between vitamin B12 deficiency and other conditions, like cancer, as their symptoms—such as fatigue, weight loss, and digestive problems—can overlap. This is particularly challenging in older adults, where these signs may be mistaken for aging or other health issues.

While most cases are related to diet or absorption problems, in rare cases, low vitamin B12 levels may signal something more serious.

## Common Causes of Vitamin B12 Deficiency

Vitamin B12 isn’t made by the body. You get it from food, mainly meat, fish, eggs, and dairy.

The stomach uses a protein called [**intrinsic factor**](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002381.htm#:~:text=Intrinsic%20factor%20is%20a%20protein,cells%20in%20the%20stomach%20lining.) to help absorb it.

If your diet **lacks B12** or your **body can’t absorb it properly**, you may develop a deficiency.

### Dietary Causes

- **Low intake of animal-based foods**: Vitamin B12 is found in meat, fish, eggs, and dairy products. People following vegetarian or vegan diets are at higher risk of deficiency. Strict vegans may develop a deficiency after about [three years without enough B12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK441923/) in their diet.
- **Unbalanced diets**: Skipping meals or relying on processed foods can lead to inadequate B12 levels.

### Absorption Problems

- **Digestive disorders**: Conditions like Crohn’s disease can damage the gut lining. This makes it harder for the body to absorb Vitamin B12.
- **Pernicious anemia**: This autoimmune condition prevents the stomach from producing intrinsic factor.
- **Gastric surgeries**: Procedures like [gastric bypass](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/gastric-bypass-surgery/about/pac-20385189#:~:text=Overview,directly%20to%20the%20small%20intestine.) can reduce the body’s ability to absorb nutrients.

### Age-Related Factors

- **Reduced stomach acid**: As people age, stomach acid production decreases. This acid is necessary to release B12 from food.
- **Chronic medication use**: Certain drugs, such as antacids or metformin, can interfere with B12 absorption over time.

## Can Vitamin B12 Deficiency Be a Sign of Cancer?

Vitamin B12 deficiency is usually caused by common issues, like a poor diet or trouble absorbing nutrients. However, in some rare cases, it might be linked to cancer.

Some cancers can affect how your body absorbs vitamin B12, especially those in the digestive system. These include:

- **Stomach Cancer**: This cancer can harm the stomach lining. It stops the stomach from making intrinsic factor, which helps absorb vitamin B12.
- **Colorectal Cancer**: Digestive problems like diarrhea or weight loss from this cancer can lead to low vitamin B12.
- **Pancreatic Cancer**: The pancreas helps with digestion. Pancreatic cancer can cause poor absorption of nutrients, including B12.
- **Esophageal Cancer**: Swallowing and digestion issues from this cancer may lead to B12 deficiency.

These cancers rarely cause B12 deficiency but show why persistent symptoms shouldn't be ignored.

Some research suggests that Vitamin B12 deficiency might raise the risk of stomach cancer. A [study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8126961/#mnfr3932-sec-0120) found that low B12 levels can cause problems with DNA repair and stability, which may lead to cancer.

However, the link between B12 deficiency and cancer is not fully clear and needs more research.

## When Should You See a Doctor?

You should see a doctor if you have symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency that don’t go away.

It’s especially important to get medical advice if these issues occur alongside potential cancer warning signs, such as:

- Unexplained weight loss.
- Changes in appetite.
- Ongoing digestive problems, like bloating or diarrhea.

Don’t ignore these red flags. Early testing can reveal deficiencies and uncover potential health concerns.

A doctor can identify the cause and recommend treatment. Early care prevents complications and uncovers serious conditions.

## How to Test and Treat B12 Deficiency

### Testing for Vitamin B12 Deficiency

Diagnosing a vitamin B12 deficiency often begins with simple tests, such as [blood tests](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview) to measure:

- **Vitamin B12 levels**: Determines if your levels are below the normal range.
- [**Homocysteine**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/homocysteine): An amino acid in your blood. High levels may indicate a Vitamin B12 deficiency.
- **Methylmalonic acid (MMA)**: A substance involved in energy production. Elevated MMA can signal low vitamin B12 levels.

Doctors may also recommend a [**nutritional panel**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/nutritional-tests), which provides a broader overview of your vitamin and mineral levels. This test can help identify if other deficiencies might be contributing to your symptoms.

If a deficiency is found, further tests may be done to identify the cause. For example:

- [**Endoscopy**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/25126-endoscopy): To check for damage to the stomach or intestines.
- **Imaging or biopsies**: Help detect underlying issues like cancer or other serious conditions.

Clear testing helps avoid delays in diagnosing the true cause.

### Treating Vitamin B12 Deficiency

Treating vitamin B12 deficiency means addressing the cause and bringing your levels back to normal. It depends on how severe the deficiency is and the reason behind it.

It’s essential to treat the condition causing the deficiency to prevent a recurrence. Without this, dietary changes and supplement therapy may not be effective.

#### Dietary Changes

Eating more vitamin B12-rich foods is usually enough for mild deficiencies from a poor diet.

These include:

- **Meat**: Beef, chicken, and organ meats like liver.
- **Fish and seafood**: Salmon, tuna, trout, and shellfish.
- **Dairy products**: Milk, cheese, yogurt, and other dairy-based foods.
- **Eggs**: A simple source of B12, especially in the yolk.
- **Fortified foods**: Plant-based products like cereals, nutritional yeast, and plant-based milk often contain added Vitamin B12. It makes them great options for vegans and vegetarians.

For most healthy adults, the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for vitamin B12 is about **2.4 micrograms per day**, according to the [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-facts-label/daily-value-nutrition-and-supplement-facts-labels).

People at risk, like vegetarians or vegans, may need fortified foods or supplements to meet this requirement.

![vitamin B12-rich foods](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2F8026fe8cbf4073e7051a241060b31ee1.png&w=3840&q=100)

_Vitamin B12-rich foods_

#### Supplements

When dietary changes alone are not enough, vitamin B12 supplements can help restore levels:

- **Oral supplements**: Doctors often recommend this for individuals with mild deficiencies. It is also useful for those needing long-term supplementation due to dietary restrictions.
- **Sublingual tablets**: They dissolve under the tongue and work well for mild absorption issues.
- **Injections**: Injections are best for severe deficiencies or absorption problems, like pernicious anemia or gastric surgery. They deliver B12 directly into the bloodstream, skipping the digestive system.

Your doctor will decide the dosage and frequency based on your specific needs. In some cases, doctors give injections weekly until levels stabilize. After that, maintenance doses are given every few months.

Untreated B12 deficiency can lead to serious problems, including **permanent nerve damage**. Starting treatment promptly restores your vitamin B12 levels and prevents further complications.

[Recovery from vitamin B12 deficiency](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/vitamin-b12-deficiency-recovery-duration) depends on how severe it is and how quickly treatment begins. Symptoms like fatigue often improve within weeks, but neurological issues may take months.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### \#\#\# Can Vitamin B12 deficiency ever fully mimic cancer symptoms?

Yes, vitamin B12 deficiency can cause similar symptoms to cancer, like feeling very tired, losing weight, or having digestive problems. However, it doesn’t cause some cancer-specific signs, like lumps or severe pain.

Testing is important to find the real cause of the symptoms.

### \#\#\# What’s the difference between B12 deficiency fatigue and cancer-related fatigue?

B12 deficiency fatigue usually gets better with treatment, like taking supplements or eating more B12-rich foods.

Cancer fatigue is often more severe and doesn’t improve as easily, even with rest. It may also come with other cancer signs, like fever or night sweats.

## Conclusion

Vitamin B12 deficiency is often linked to simple causes like diet or absorption issues, and in most cases, it’s nothing to worry about if treated in time. While it’s true that very rare cases might be associated with cancer, this is highly uncommon.

If you’re feeling tired, weak, or have other symptoms, it’s important to see a doctor to confirm that it’s just a B12 deficiency. Early testing and treatment can bring reassurance and help you get back to feeling your best.
