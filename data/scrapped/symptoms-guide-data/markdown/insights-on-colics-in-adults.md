## Types of Colics in Adults

### Biliary Colic

Biliary colic occurs when a gallstone temporarily blocks the bile ducts, which are pathways that carry bile from the liver and [gallbladder](https://docus.ai/tags/gallbladder) to the intestine. This blockage causes the gallbladder to contract vigorously, leading to intense pain.

#### Causes

The primary cause of biliary colic is the presence of gallstones, which are solid particles that form from bile [cholesterol](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/cholesterol) and [bilirubin](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/bilirubin) in the gallbladder.

#### Symptoms

The symptoms of biliary colic can be quite distinctive, and knowing them can help in seeking timely medical intervention:

- Sudden and severe pain in the upper right abdomen or just under the ribs on the right side
- Pain that radiates to the back or right shoulder blade
- Episodes of pain that occur after eating, especially meals high in fat

### Renal Colic

Renal colic is acute pain caused by kidney stones that block the flow of urine in the urinary tract. This blockage causes the kidney to swell and the ureter to spasm, which can be extremely painful.

#### Causes

Kidney stones form when there are high levels of certain minerals in the urine. Dehydration, certain diets, and genetic factors can increase the risk of stone formation.

#### Symptoms

Identifying symptoms of renal colic is crucial for early treatment and relief:

- Sharp, severe pain in the lower back or side of the body, extending to the groin and thighs
- [Nausea](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/remedies-and-foods-to-help-with-nausea) and vomiting
- Blood in the urine or painful urination

### Intestinal Colic

Intestinal colic, often referred to simply as abdominal colic in adults, involves pain due to spasms in the intestinal muscles caused by blockages in the intestines.

#### Causes

Common causes include obstructive lesions like tumors or strictures, impacted feces, and severe infections.

#### Symptoms

Recognizing the symptoms of intestinal colic can aid in diagnosing and treating the condition more effectively:

- Cramping pain throughout the abdomen
- Bloating and abdominal distension
- Vomiting and the inability to pass stool or gas

If you experience any of the symptoms mentioned, it’s essential to consult a healthcare provider or check symptoms using online tools like [Symptom Checker for Adults](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker/symptom-checker-for-adults) to get a preliminary assessment.

## Causes and Treatment of Colic in Adults

Understanding what triggers colic in adults is essential for managing and preventing this uncomfortable condition. While the exact cause can vary, several factors are commonly associated with its onset.

### Dietary Influences

One of the primary culprits behind colic pain in adults is diet. Foods that are hard to digest or that trigger allergies can lead to intense abdominal pain. It's essential to consider the impact of eating disorders on gastrointestinal health.

Common dietary triggers include:

- Dairy products for those who are lactose intolerant
- High-fiber foods that cause gas and bloating
- Spicy foods that irritate the digestive system
- Processed foods rich in additives and preservatives

#### Diet Modification

- For lactose intolerance, avoid dairy or choose lactose-free alternatives.
- Reduce intake of high-fiber foods that cause excessive gas and bloating, or gradually increase fiber intake to allow the body to adjust.
- Avoid spicy foods if they exacerbate gastrointestinal symptoms.
- Limit processed foods high in additives and preservatives which can irritate the digestive tract.

### Gastrointestinal Conditions

One of the primary culprits behind colic pain in adults is gastrointestinal distress. Conditions like Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease, and food intolerances can trigger severe abdominal pain, mimicking the unpredictable, acute discomfort associated with colic. These issues often lead to spasms in the gut, causing waves of pain that characterize colic symptoms.

#### Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)

A disorder causing abdominal pain, bloating, and irregular bowel habits. Remarkably prevalent, IBS affects between **25 and 45 million** people in the United States as per [IFFGD](https://aboutibs.org/what-is-ibs/facts-about-ibs/#:~:text=IBS%20Population%20Statistics&text=IBS%20affects%20between%2025%20and,in%20the%20community%20are%20male.). This condition demonstrates how significant gastrointestinal health is to overall comfort and well-being.

**Treatment options:**

- **Dietary Adjustments**: Implement a low-FODMAP diet to identify and avoid foods that trigger symptoms.
- **Medications**: Use antispasmodic medications to reduce intestinal spasms or laxatives and fiber supplements for constipation-predominant IBS.
- **Stress Management**: Techniques such as yoga, meditation, or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to manage stress, which can exacerbate symptoms.

#### Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)

[GERD](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/overview-of-gerd) is a condition where stomach acid frequently flows back into the tube connecting your mouth and stomach.

**Treatment options:**

- **Elevate Head of Bed**: Make lifestyle changes such as elevating the head of the bed and avoiding meals close to bedtime.
- **Acid Reducers**: Use over-the-counter antacids or prescription medications to reduce stomach acid production.
- **Dietary Changes**: Avoid foods that trigger reflux, such as fatty foods, coffee, and chocolate.

#### Gallstones

Hardened deposits in the gallbladder that can cause sudden and severe abdominal pain.

Treatment options:

- **Pain Management**: Use pain relief medications as recommended by a healthcare provider.
- **Surgical Options**: In cases of frequent gallstone attacks, surgical removal of the gallbladder may be considered.
- **Dietary Adjustments**: Maintain a healthy weight and eat a balanced diet that is low in fat and cholesterol.

### Urinary Tract Issues

Urinary conditions, including kidney stones and infections, can also manifest as colic in adults. These conditions cause sharp, intense pain in the back, side, lower abdomen, or groin, often described as colic due to its severity and sudden onset.

#### Kidney Stones

Hard deposits formed in the kidneys that can cause severe pain as they [move through the urinary tract](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/stages-of-passing-kidney-stone).

Treatment options:

- **Pain Relief**: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to manage pain.
- **Fluid Intake**: Increase water consumption to help stones pass more easily.
- **Medical Procedures**: For larger stones, procedures such as lithotripsy (shock waves to break stones) or surgical removal may be necessary.

### Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)

[UTIs](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/bladder-infection-vs-uti#what-is-a-uti) are Infections in any part of the urinary system, often causing painful urination and abdominal discomfort.

Treatment options:

- **Antibiotics**: Prompt treatment with antibiotics to eliminate the infection.
- **Pain Relief**: Use over-the-counter pain relievers to alleviate discomfort.
- **Increase Fluid Intake**: Drinking more fluids helps to flush out bacteria from the urinary system.
