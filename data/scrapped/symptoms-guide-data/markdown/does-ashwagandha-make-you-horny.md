## What is Ashwagandha?

Ashwagandha, scientifically known as Withania Somnifera (WS), is a small shrub with yellow flowers that grows in India and Southeast Asia. It is also known as Indian ginseng or winter cherry. This herb is well-regarded in the medical community for its adaptogenic properties, which help the body cope with stress and maintain balance.

Medically, ashwagandha is rich in bioactive compounds like withanolides, which have anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and anti-stress properties. These compounds help reduce [cortisol levels](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/cortisol#cortisol-levels), mitigating the effects of chronic stress.

Ashwagandha also contains alkaloids and saponins, adding to its therapeutic benefits. In clinical settings, it supports mental health, improves cognitive function, and boosts overall vitality, enhancing brain function, memory, reaction times, and physical performance.

## Does Ashwagandha Help Increase Libido?

### How Stress Affects Sexual Health

Stress is a common factor that negatively impacts sexual health. According to [Gallup](https://news.gallup.com/poll/224336/eight-americans-afflicted-stress.aspx), **8 in 10** Americans encounter stress every day. [APA](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2022/concerned-future-inflation) reports that **76%** of adults experiencing stress also suffer from related symptoms such as **headaches (38%)**, **[fatigue](https://docus.ai/tags/fatigue) (35%)**, **nervousness or [anxiety](https://docus.ai/tags/anxiety) (34%)**, and/or feelings of **depression or sadness (33%)**.

When the body experiences stress, it produces higher levels of **cortisol**, a hormone that can disrupt the balance of other hormones, including those related to sexual function.

High cortisol levels can lead to decreased **libido**, **erectile dysfunction**, and overall reduced **sexual performance**. Common causes of stress-related sexual health issues include work pressure, financial problems, and relationship conflicts. These factors can create a cycle of stress and anxiety that further exacerbates sexual health problems.

### Ashwagandha as an Adaptogen for Reducing Stress

Ashwagandha is classified as an **adaptogen**, a natural substance that helps the body adapt to stress and normalize bodily processes. According to the NCBI [publication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4270108/), adaptogens like ashwagandha work by modulating the stress response and reducing cortisol levels. This helps **restore hormonal balance** and **supports overall well-being**.

By lowering stress, ashwagandha can indirectly improve **sexual health**. It promotes relaxation, reduces anxiety, and enhances mood, which are essential for a healthy libido. Incorporating ashwagandha into your daily routine can help you manage stress better and improve your sexual health.

## Scientific Evidence on Ashwagandha and Sexual Desire

### Research on Ashwagandha and Male Sexual Health

Several studies have explored the impact of ashwagandha on male sexual health, focusing on [testosterone levels](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/testosterone#testosterone-levels-by-age-group), sperm quality, and fertility. The NCBI-published [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6750292/) found that men who took ashwagandha experienced a significant increase in testosterone levels, which is crucial for maintaining libido and sexual performance.

Another study from [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23796876/) showed that ashwagandha supplementation improved sperm quality, including sperm count and motility, making it beneficial for men facing fertility issues.Â Ashwagandha can enhance libido and sexual performance.

### Research on Ashwagandha and Female Sexual Health

Research published by [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4609357/) on ashwagandha's effects on female sexual health has also shown promising results. Studies indicate that **ashwagandha can help balance hormones**, which is essential for maintaining a healthy libido.

Women experiencing hormonal imbalances, such as those caused by [**menopause**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/about-menopause) or [**polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/pcos-overview), may find relief with ashwagandha. [Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8985838/) suggests that it balances hormones and reduces stress, improves [insulin](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/insulin) sensitivity, and lowers blood sugar levels, which can improve reproductive health and overall well-being in women

ResearchGate [publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282644143_Clinical_Study_Efficacy_and_Safety_of_Ashwagandha_Withania_somnifera_Root_Extract_in_Improving_Sexual_Function_in_Women_A_Pilot_Study) reveals that women who took ashwagandha reported improvements in sexual satisfaction, including increased **arousal** and **lubrication**. The herb's stress-reducing properties also contribute to its positive effects on sexual health, as **lower stress** levels can enhance sexual desire and performance.
