Stomach noises are a normal part of digestion. They happen when food, gas, and fluids move through the intestines. Most of the time, they are harmless.

But if these noises become persistent, unusual, or appear with other symptoms, they may signal an underlying issue.

## What is Bowel Cancer?

Bowel cancer, or colorectal cancer, starts in the lining of the large intestine (colon and rectum). If left untreated, it can spread to other parts of the body.

According to the **World Health Organization (** [**WHO**](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/colorectal-cancer#:~:text=Colon%20cancer%20is%20the%20second,and%20mortality%20rates%20were%20observed.) **),** colorectal cancer is the **third most common cancer worldwide.** It accounts for about **10% of all cancer cases** and is the **second leading cause of cancer-related deaths.**

Early detection can improve survival rates. Understanding the symptoms and risk factors can help with prevention and timely medical intervention.

## Symptoms of Bowel Cancer

### Early Warning Signs

Detecting bowel cancer early increases treatment success. Common early symptoms include:

- **Changes in Bowel Habits:** Persistent diarrhea, constipation, or stool changes lasting more than a few days.
- **Blood in the Stool:** Bright red or dark-colored blood in stool.
- **Abdominal Discomfort:** Frequent bloating, gas, or cramps.
- **Stomach Noises:** Gurgling or rumbling noises with other symptoms may need medical attention.
- **Unexplained Weight Loss:** Losing weight without changes in diet or exercise.
- **Incomplete Bowel Emptying:** Feeling like your bowel doesn’t fully empty.
- **Weakness or Fatigue:** Unusual tiredness that does not improve with rest.
- **Anemia:** Low iron levels due to chronic bleeding from a tumor.

For those noticing initial signs or seeking more information on symptoms related to bowel health, exploring resources like the [Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker) can be a helpful first step.

However, it's essential to remember that online tools are not substitutes for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

### Advanced Symptoms

If bowel cancer progresses, symptoms can become more severe:

- **Severe Abdominal Pain:** Persistent pain that worsens over time.
- **Bowel Obstruction:** Severe constipation, abdominal swelling, and pain.
- **Significant Weight Loss:** Drastic and unexplained weight loss.
- **Chronic Fatigue:** Extreme tiredness that does not improve with rest.
- **Rectal Bleeding:** Heavy bleeding from the rectum.
- **Iron-Deficiency Anemia:** Persistent low iron levels.
- **Visible Tumor Changes:** In severe cases, a tumor may be visible or felt near the rectum.

If you notice any of these signs, **seek medical attention immediately.** Early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes.

## Stomach Noises and Bowel Cancer

Stomach noises, such as gurgling or rumbling, are generally not considered a direct sign of bowel cancer.

These sounds are typically normal and are caused by the movement of gas and fluid through the intestines.

They can occur in many benign conditions related to digestion, such as **indigestion**, **dietary changes**, or **temporary gastrointestinal upset**.

However, if these noises are accompanied by other symptoms like **changes in bowel habits**, **persistent abdominal pain**, **blood in the stool**, or **unexplained weight loss**, it would be prudent to consult a healthcare professional.

These additional symptoms could potentially indicate bowel cancer or another serious gastrointestinal condition.

## Other Causes of Stomach Noises

Not all stomach noises are linked to bowel cancer. Other common causes include:

- **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS):** Causes bloating, cramping, and irregular bowel movements.
- **Food Intolerances:** Some people struggle to digest certain foods, leading to excessive gas and bloating.
- **Gastrointestinal Infections:** Viruses, bacteria, or parasites can disrupt digestion, causing unusual stomach noises.

## Diagnosis and Screening

The diagnosis of bowel cancer starts with a **medical history review** and a **physical exam**, including a **digital rectal examination (DRE)** to check for abnormalities in the lower rectum.

For a **detailed investigation**, doctors may recommend a **colonoscopy** or **CT colonography** (virtual colonoscopy).

- **Colonoscopy**: A flexible tube with a camera examines the entire colon and rectum, detecting polyps, cancer, and other issues.
- **CT Colonography**: A **less invasive** imaging test that provides detailed pictures of the colon without sedation.

**Screening is crucial for early detection** and better treatment outcomes. Guidelines recommend starting **regular screening at age 45 to 50** using methods like the **fecal immunochemical test (FIT)** or colonoscopy.

## When to See a Doctor

See a doctor if you experience:

- Persistent changes in bowel habits.
- Blood in your stool.
- Frequent or unusual stomach noises with other symptoms.
- Unexplained weight loss or ongoing fatigue.
- Severe abdominal pain or bloating.

Early medical evaluation **can save lives.**

## Tips to Lower the Risk of Bowel Cancer

While some risk factors for bowel cancer, such as genetics, cannot be controlled, certain lifestyle changes may help lower the risk.

- **Increase calcium intake**: Dairy products, dark leafy greens, and calcium-fortified non-dairy milks may help protect against bowel cancer. As reported in [OncoDaily](https://oncodaily.com/insight/milk-222975), researchers recently found that consuming more calcium—about the amount in a glass of milk daily—was linked to a **17% lower risk of bowel cancer**.
- **Eat a high-fiber diet**: Whole grains, fruits, and vegetables support healthy digestion and may reduce cancer risk.
- **Limit red and processed meats**: Research links excessive consumption to a higher risk of bowel cancer.
- **Reduce alcohol consumption**: The same Oxford study found that drinking an additional large glass of wine daily increased bowel cancer risk by **15%**.
- **Maintain a healthy weight**: Obesity is a known risk factor for colorectal cancer.
- **Stay active**: Regular physical activity supports healthy digestion and reduces inflammation.
- **Get screened regularly**: Early detection through colonoscopies or stool tests significantly improves survival rates
