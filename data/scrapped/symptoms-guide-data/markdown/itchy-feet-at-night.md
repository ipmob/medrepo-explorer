## Why Do Your Feet Itch at Night?

When dusk falls and you finally lay down, expecting a peaceful rest, the unexpected sensation of itchy feet can be perplexing and frustrating. Let's explore the main culprits behind this bothersome condition.

### Dry Skin

The simplest yet widespread cause is dry skin. It lacks moisture, leading to itchiness, particularly pronounced at night when our body temperature tends to drop, making the skin feel even drier. Regular moisturizing before bed can be a simple remedy for those wondering how to relieve itchy feet at night.

### Fungal Infections

[Fungal infections](https://docus.ai/tags/fungal-infection), such as **athlete's foot**, thrive in the warm, moist environments found between toes and on the soles of the feet. This condition can cause the itchy top of feet at night and itchy bottom of feet at night, often accompanied by peeling skin or redness. Maintaining foot hygiene and keeping feet dry can help prevent such infections.

### Peripheral Neuropathy

**Peripheral neuropathy**, as [described](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/peripheral-neuropathy) by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, involves **damage to the peripheral nervous system**. This damage can lead to itchy feet at night without a visible rash, as the nerves responsible for sensation in the feet misfire. It highlights the complexity of our body's nervous system and its impact on sensations like itchiness.

### Pregnancy

Many women experience itchy feet during pregnancy at night, attributed to the natural changes and increased strain on the body during this period. The precise reasons can vary, from **hormonal adjustments** to the **stretching of the skin**.

### Allergic Reactions

[Allergies](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/allergy-attack) to specific fabrics, detergents, or even personal care products can lead to itchy hands and feet at night. Identifying and avoiding these allergens is crucial for those affected.

### Medical Conditions

Certain medical conditions like **liver disease**, **kidney failure**, or **[diabetes](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/itchy-feet-diabetes)** can cause itchy feet at night. These conditions may lead to a buildup of toxins in the body due to impaired organ function, which often results in generalized itching, including the feet.

## Prevention and Relief for Itchy Feet at Night

If you're struggling with itchy feet at night, here are several practical tips that can help you find relief and improve your sleep:

- **Moisturize Regularly**: Before going to bed, apply a thick, fragrance-free moisturizer to your feet. Look for ingredients like glycerin, urea, or shea butter, which can help lock in moisture and soothe the skin.
- **Maintain Good Hygiene**: Wash your feet daily with mild soap and warm water. Thoroughly dry your feet, especially between the toes, to prevent fungal infections which can cause itchiness.
- **Wear Breathable Socks**: Opt for socks made of materials that wick moisture away from the skin, such as bamboo, merino wool, or moisture-wicking synthetics. This can help keep your feet dry and reduce irritation.
- **Choose the Right Footwear**: During the day, wear shoes that are well-ventilated and fit properly. Avoid shoes that are too tight or made from materials that donâ€™t allow your feet to breathe.
- **Cool Down Your Feet**: Sometimes cooling your feet can help relieve itchiness. Try a cool foot bath before bed or use a cool, damp cloth as a compress.
- **Manage Allergies**: If allergies are causing the itchiness, consider taking an antihistamine before bed or use topical anti-itch creams specifically designed for allergic reactions.
- **Trim Nails Properly**: Keep your toenails neatly trimmed to prevent them from scratching your skin, which can worsen the itch.
- **Use a Humidifier**: If dry air is contributing to your itchy feet, using a humidifier in your bedroom can add moisture to the air and help prevent your skin from drying out.
