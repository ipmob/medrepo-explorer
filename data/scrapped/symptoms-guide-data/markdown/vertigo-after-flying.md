Vertigo after flying, often known as " **airplane ear**," is a condition that can occur after air travel and is attributed to changes in air pressure during ascent and descent.

Managing this condition is crucial as it can significantly impact one's daily activities and overall quality of life.

## Causes of Vertigo After Flying

Can flying cause vertigo? Absolutely, and understanding these causes is the first step towards managing and preventing the condition effectively.

### Changes in Air Pressure

One common cause of [vertigo](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/sinus-infection-vertigo-symptoms-causes-and-management) after flying stems from **changes in cabin pressure**. When an airplane ascends or descends, the air pressure inside the cabin alters to balance with the atmospheric pressure outside. This rapid change can affect the inner ear, where balance is regulated.

The inner ear contains small organs that help the brain understand the body's position. If the pressure changes are too abrupt, these organs can become confused, sending mixed signals to the brain and causing feelings of dizziness or vertigo.

### Ear Canal Issues

The Eustachian tube, a small canal that connects the middle ear to the back of the throat, plays a crucial role in maintaining equal air pressure on both sides of the eardrum. During flights, especially during takeoff and landing, this tube can sometimes fail to open properly due to the fast changes in altitude and air pressure. This can lead to a pressure imbalance, affecting the ear's vestibular system and leading to vertigo.

According to the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/airplane-ear/symptoms-causes/syc-20351701), airplane ear ( **ear barotrauma**) is the stress on your eardrum that occurs when the air pressure in your middle ear and the air pressure in the environment are out of balance.

You might get airplane ear when on an airplane that's climbing after takeoff or descending for landing. Individuals with existing ear canal issues are particularly susceptible to experiencing vertigo after flying due to this reason.

### Dehydration

Flying can also lead to dehydration due to the low humidity levels in airplane cabins. Dehydration can thin the blood and decrease the pressure inside the vessels, which can adversely affect the inner ear and its ability to maintain balance. This is how [dehydration can exacerbate or trigger vertigo](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/dehydration-cause-vertigo) in susceptible individuals.

## Vertigo After Flying: How Long Does It Last?

The duration of vertigo after flying can vary significantly from one person to another.

For most, the symptoms are short-lived, lasting only a **few hours to a couple of days**.

However, in cases where vertigo is triggered by more significant issues, such as a **severe imbalance in ear pressure** or an **underlying condition**, symptoms could last longer.

It's crucial to monitor the situation and consult a healthcare professional if vertigo persists or is accompanied by more severe symptoms, such as hearing loss or extreme disorientation.

## How to Treat Vertigo After Flying?

Addressing vertigo after flying involves a range of treatment options, tailored to the severity and underlying causes of the condition.

### Over-the-Counter Solutions

- **Antihistamines and Anticholinergics**: These medications can help control nausea and motion sickness, common symptoms associated with vertigo. They work by blocking certain pathways in the brain that trigger these symptoms.
- **Decongestants**: If vertigo is related to pressure changes affecting the ear, decongestants may help by reducing swelling in the nasal passages and the Eustachian tubes, facilitating easier pressure equalization.

### Prescription Medications

For more severe cases, prescription medications may be necessary:

- **Benzodiazepines**: Occasionally prescribed for their sedative effects which can help alleviate the sensation of spinning.
- **Steroids**: In cases where inflammation is contributing to vertigo, steroids can be prescribed to reduce swelling and improve ear function.

### Physical Therapy

**Vestibular rehabilitation therapy** (VRT) is a specialized form of physical therapy aimed at strengthening the vestibular system, which is responsible for maintaining balance. VRT can be particularly effective for those whose vertigo is caused by issues with the inner ear.

### Epley Maneuver

The **Epley maneuver** is a simple yet effective exercise that can be performed at home or by a healthcare professional. It's designed to move the calcium deposits that can cause vertigo from one part of the ear to another, where they can be more easily absorbed by the body.

### Lifestyle Adjustments

Making certain lifestyle changes can also significantly impact the management of vertigo symptoms:

- Staying well-hydrated, especially when flying, to avoid dehydration that can worsen symptoms.
- Performing simple exercises to improve balance and reduce the likelihood of vertigo episodes.

## Prevention of Vertigo After Flying

Taking preventive measures can significantly reduce the risk of experiencing vertigo after flying:

- **Hydration**: Drink plenty of fluids before, during, and after your flight to prevent dehydration.
- **Ear Pressure Equalization Techniques**: Chewing gum, yawning, and swallowing during ascent and descent can help balance the pressure in your ears.
- **Avoid Alcohol and Caffeine**: These substances can exacerbate dehydration and potentially increase the risk of vertigo.
- **Select Seats Away from the Wing**: These seats tend to experience less motion during the flight, which may help reduce the risk of motion sickness leading to vertigo.
- **Use of Earplugs**: Specially designed earplugs for flying can help moderate the changes in air pressure and reduce the likelihood of ear barotrauma.

Incorporating these practices can help manage and reduce the chances of vertigo after flying, ensuring a more comfortable and enjoyable travel experience.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### \#\#\# Can flying cause vertigo?

Yes, flying can cause vertigo due to the rapid changes in air pressure, which affect the inner ear, a key player in maintaining balance. The condition known as "airplane ear" or ear barotrauma can contribute to this sensation.

### \#\#\# How long does vertigo after flying last?

The duration of vertigo after flying varies from person to person. While most individuals find relief within a few hours to days, those with underlying conditions or severe cases may experience symptoms for a longer period. Consulting a healthcare provider is recommended if symptoms persist.

### \#\#\# What are the treatment options for vertigo after flying?

Treatment for vertigo after flying includes over-the-counter medications for immediate relief of symptoms like nausea, prescription medications for more severe cases, vestibular rehabilitation therapy for inner ear issues, the Epley maneuver for specific types of vertigo, and lifestyle adjustments to manage and prevent symptoms. Additionally, employing preventive measures before and during flights can help reduce the likelihood of vertigo occurrences.
