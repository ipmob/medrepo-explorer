## What Causes Bump on the Roof of Mouth?

### 1\. Torus Palatinus

[Torus palatinus](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/torus-palatinus) is a bony, benign growth located in the center of the roof of the mouth. The bump can be **smooth or rough to the touch**. People can be born with it or get it later in life. According to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24829-torus-palatinus), torus palatinus is prevalent in **20%** to **30%** of the general population and is more common in women and people assigned female at birth.

The etiology of this condition remains unknown, however, it is believed there may be a relation to genetic factors or chronic irritation. In most cases, people suffering from torus palatinus do not feel any pain unless it is provoked by food or dental devices. Torus palatinus only requires treatment if it becomes bothersome. In that case, the surgeon may perform oral surgery to remove the formation.

### 2\. Nasopalatine Duct Cyst

A nasopalatine duct cyst forms when a small piece of tissue from the nasopalatine duct (a structure present during early development) remains after birth. This cyst develops near the **front of the hard palate**, which is the **bony part** of the roof of your mouth.

This condition appears as a swelling that is not painful, although occasionally it can be associated with some degree of discomfort or pain, especially when it gets infected. Usually, dentists discover this type of cyst during a routine dental X-ray. The nasopalatine duct cyst requires surgical removal.

### 3\. Mucoceles

Mucocele happens when the ducts of the salivary glands become blocked or damaged. This blockage prevents saliva from being released properly, causing it to accumulate and form a **small**, **fluid-filled bump**. Cleveland Clinics [reports](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23406-oral-mucocele) that this condition affects mostly people **under 30**, with 3 to 20-year-olds making up **70%** of the cases, however, it can affect people of any age.

Mucoceles occur most frequently on the lips, with less common occurrences inside the mouth, such as on the roof of the mouth. Typically, mucoceles are small, soft, bluish lumps that are painless and go away independently.

### 4\. Squamous Papilloma

[Squamous papilloma](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/squamous-papilloma) is a benign growth that is usually induced by the human papillomavirus (HPV). It appears as a small, raised **cauliflower-like bump** that may be white or pink. This generally occurs on the roof of the mouth, [tongue](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/hpv-bumps-on-back-of-tongue), or inside the cheek. According to a report from [Cureus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10174681/), squamous papilloma affects about **one in every 250 individuals**, mostly between the ages of 30 and 50, however, it may sometimes affect children below 10. Although squamous papilloma can be uncomfortable if it becomes irritated or grows in size, it is usually painless and may be left untreated.

### 5\. Canker Sores

Aphthous ulcers, or canker sores, are painful little sores appearing on any part inside the mouth including the roof. Minor canker sores may occur **3 to 4 times a year**, as stated by [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/canker-sores). Their exact cause is unknown, but they seem to be associated with such factors as [stress](https://docus.ai/tags/stress), trauma, and certain types of food.

Generally, they appear as **small white or yellowish dots** surrounded by **bright red and swollen tissue**. Most of these small sores on the roof of the mouth typically heal on their own with little to no treatment needed.

### 6\. Cold Sores

Cold sores, also called fever blisters, are caused by the herpes simplex virus, type 1 (HSV-1). They occur on the lips and sometimes as far away as your nose or the roof of your mouth. Starting as **small**, **clear blisters**, they break and form painful sores. They are mildly contagious and can flare up when you are stressed, sick, or exposed to the sun. They heal in about a week to ten days.

### 7\. Epstein Pearls

[Epstein pearls](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/epstein-pearls) are **small**, **white cysts** that appear on the gums or the roof of the mouth in the **newborn**. Mount Sinai [notes](https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/diseases-conditions/epstein-pearls#:~:text=Epstein%20pearls%20occur%20only%20in,4%20out%20of%205%20newborns.) that they appear in about **4 out of 5 newborns**. They are benign and occur because keratin, a protein in the skin, builds up. These small bumps on the roof of the mouth often disappear by themselves in a few weeks and do not require treatment.

### 8\. Hyperdontia

Hyperdontia is the presence of extra teeth. Sometimes they can develop in unusual positions, such as from the roof of the mouth. WebMD [shares](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/what-is-hyperdontia-extra-teeth) that an extra tooth is recorded in **up to 3.8% of people**. These teeth can sometimes cause localized visible bulges. They are usually diagnosed incidentally using routine dental X-rays and may cause local irritation or even the displacement of other teeth.

### 9\. Ectopic Teeth

Ectopic teeth refer to teeth that **erupt in an abnormal position in the mouth**, outside their usual location. This can occur due to developmental anomalies, crowding, or other underlying factors.

Ectopic teeth can appear in various parts of the mouth, including the **roof of the mouth**, the **nasal cavity**, or even the **sinus areas**. This condition can affect both **children** and **adults** and may lead to various dental complications. Dentists typically discover ectopic teeth during routine X-rays, and depending on their position and impact, they may recommend removal to prevent further complications.

### 10\. Burns and other injuries

The flesh of the roof of your mouth is very tender and subjected to a variety of injuries such as burns, cuts, and irritation. In the case of more serious burns, healing often consists of the formation of a **fluid-filled blister**. Most cause swelling, blisters, or bumps that may be painful but usually heal without treatment in a few days.

### 11\. Candidiasis

Oral candidiasis, or oral thrush, is a [fungal infection](https://docus.ai/tags/fungal-infection) caused by Candida yeast. It causes **creamy white lesions** that commonly affect the tongue and inner cheeks but can also spread to the roof of the mouth. Symptoms include white patches, soreness, and a burning sensation.

It's more common among children but people with weakened immune systems are also more prone to candidiasis. Healthcare providers often prescribe antifungal treatments to manage oral thrush. Thrush typically clears up within one to two weeks with proper treatment.

### 12\. Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease

Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease is a [viral infection](https://docus.ai/tags/viral-infections) that causes **sores** in the mouth and a **[rash](https://docus.ai/tags/rash)** on the hands and feet. According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/hand-foot-mouth/about/index.html), while Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease is most common in children **under 5 years old**, it can affect individuals of any age. The sores can appear on the roof of the mouth, tongue, and gums, causing discomfort. Other than the sores children may experience [fever](https://docus.ai/tags/fever) and dehydration as it gets hard to swallow. The disease is usually mild and resolves within 7 to 10 days.

### 13\. Oral Cancer

Oral cancer can develop on the roof of the mouth and may present as a **persistent lump**, **sore**, or **ulcer** that does not heal. Other symptoms include pain, difficulty swallowing, and unexplained [weight loss](https://docus.ai/tags/weight-loss). Smoking and heavy alcohol consumption are significant risk factors. Early detection is crucial for better treatment outcomes. The key distinction between a common bump and possible cancer is that these changes persist. If untreated, oral cancer can spread beyond the mouth and throat to other parts of the head and neck.

For all of these conditions, it's important to stress the need to consult a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and suitable treatment. If you are uncertain about your symptoms, utilize the [Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker) to identify your conditions.
