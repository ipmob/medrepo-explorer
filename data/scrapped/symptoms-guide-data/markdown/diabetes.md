## What is Diabetes?

**Diabetes** is a chronic condition that occurs when the body cannot properly process blood sugar ( [glucose](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/glucose)). Glucose is a vital energy source for the cells that make up muscles and tissues and is also the brain's primary fuel.

Diabetes affects people of **all ages**, from children to older adults, and can significantly impact quality of life. Consistently high blood glucose can cause various health issues, such as **heart disease**, **nerve damage**, and **eye problems**.

Normally, [insulin](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/insulin), a hormone produced by the pancreas, helps glucose enter the cells. When the body doesn't produce enough insulin or cannot effectively use the insulin it produces, glucose builds up in the blood, leading to **high blood sugar levels**, or **hyperglycemia**.

**Note:** **_Diabetes mellitus_** _is the most common term used to describe a group of diseases mentioned above. It is essential to distinguish it from_ **_diabetes insipidus_** _, a rare condition unrelated to blood sugar levels but characterized by increased thirst and frequent urination due to a different hormonal imbalance._

## Types of Diabetes

Diabetes can manifest in several different forms, each with unique characteristics and management needs.

### Type 1 Diabetes

**Type 1 diabetes** is an [**autoimmune disease**](https://docus.ai/tags/autoimmune-diseases) where the body's immune system attacks and destroys insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This condition typically develops in childhood or adolescence but can occur at any age. People with type 1 diabetes require daily insulin injections to manage their blood sugar levels.

### Type 2 Diabetes

**Type 2 diabetes** is the most common form of diabetes, accounting for about **90-95%** of all cases, according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/about). It occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or when the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin. It primarily affects adults but is increasingly diagnosed in children and adolescents due to rising obesity rates.

### Gestational Diabetes

Gestational diabetes (GDM) develops **during** [**pregnancy**](https://docus.ai/tags/pregnancy) and usually goes away after the baby is born. The International Journal of Gynecology & Obstetrics [reports](https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijgo.14537) that gestational diabetes affects around **17 million** pregnancies globally.

**Risks for Mother and Child**

- Higher risk of high blood pressure during pregnancy
- Larger birth weight of the baby, leading to delivery complications
- Increased risk of the child developing obesity
- Increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes for both the child and the mother later in life

### Other Types of Diabetes

- **Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY):** A rare form of diabetes caused by a genetic mutation. Diabetes UK [states](https://www.diabetes.org.uk/diabetes-the-basics/other-types-of-diabetes/mody) that if a parent carries this gene mutation, there is a 50% chance that their child will inherit it. It typically occurs in adolescence or early adulthood.
- **Neonatal Diabetes:** This type appears in the first six months of life and can be transient or permanent and is caused by genetic mutation.
- **Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA):** A form of type 1 diabetes that develops slowly in adults. It is often misdiagnosed as type 2 diabetes.
- **Type 3c Diabetes:** Develops due to pancreatic damage from conditions like pancreatitis or cystic fibrosis, impacting insulin production.

## Additional Causes of Diabetes

Apart from type-specific causes, diabetes can also result from some general factors:

- A family history of diabetes increases the risk.
- Lifestyle factors such as poor diet, lack of exercise, and obesity are significant contributors to type 2 diabetes.
- Environmental triggers, such as viruses, may play a role in type 1 diabetes development.
- Hormonal changes during pregnancy can lead to gestational diabetes.

Understanding the symptoms and causes of diabetes is crucial for early detection and management.

## Symptoms of Diabetes

Diabetes symptoms can vary depending on the type of diabetes and how high your blood sugar levels are. Some of the most common symptoms include:

- Increased thirst (polydipsia)
- Frequent urination (polyuria)
- [Fatigue](https://docus.ai/tags/fatigue)
- Blurred vision
- Slow-healing sores or frequent infections
- Unexplained [weight loss](https://docus.ai/tags/weight-loss)

### Manifestation of Symptoms Based on Types

- **Type 1 Diabetes:** Symptoms tend to come on quickly and can be severe. Often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults.
- **Type 2 Diabetes:** Symptoms may develop slowly and can be mild, making them easy to overlook. Often diagnosed in adults but increasingly seen in younger populations
- **Gestational Diabetes:** Typically, gestational diabetes does not cause noticeable symptoms. Diagnosed through routine prenatal screening rather than symptoms.

## Diagnosis and Tests

Diagnosing diabetes involves measuring blood glucose levels to determine if they are higher than normal. The process typically includes a combination of medical history, physical examination, and [blood tests](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview).

### Types of Tests

To determine the type of diabetes and the appropriate management plan, various [glucose test types](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/glucose#types-of-glucose-tests) are conducted.

#### Fasting Blood Glucose Test

Ideal for routine screening, especially for individuals with risk factors for diabetes.

- Measures blood sugar levels after an overnight fast.
- A fasting blood sugar level of **126 mg/dL or higher** on two separate tests indicates diabetes.

#### Random Blood Glucose Test

Useful for diagnosing diabetes in symptomatic individuals. It's quick and convenient.

- Measures blood sugar levels at any time of the day, regardless of when you last ate.
- A blood sugar level of **200 mg/dL or higher**, along with diabetes symptoms, suggests diabetes.

#### A1c Test

Best for diagnosing diabetes and monitoring long-term glucose control.

- Also known as glycated hemoglobin test, it provides an average blood sugar level over the past two to three months.
- An A1c level of **6.5% or higher** on two separate tests indicates diabetes.

#### Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)

Primarily used for diagnosing gestational diabetes during pregnancy.

- Used primarily to diagnose gestational diabetes.
- Measures blood sugar levels before and after drinking a sugary liquid.
- A blood sugar level of **200 mg/dL or higher** two hours after drinking the liquid suggests diabetes.

Early diagnosis through these tests is essential for effective management and prevention of complications. Regular check-ups and screenings can help detect diabetes early, especially for those with risk factors such as family history or obesity.

## Management and Treatment

Effective management and treatment of diabetes involve a combination of strategies to maintain blood sugar levels within a healthy range.

### Monitoring Blood Sugar

Regular monitoring of blood sugar levels is crucial for managing diabetes. It helps individuals understand how different foods, activities, and medications affect their blood sugar.

- **Self-Monitoring:** Use a glucose meter to check blood sugar levels multiple times a day.
- **Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM):** Devices that provide real-time blood sugar readings throughout the day.

Work with healthcare providers to determine target blood sugar ranges based on individual health needs.

### Medications

Several types of medications can help manage blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. These medications work in different ways to lower blood sugar levels.

- **Oral Medications:** Commonly prescribed for type 2 diabetes, these medications help improve the body’s insulin use or increase insulin production.
- **Non-Insulin Injectables:** These medications help manage blood sugar levels by affecting the body’s response to insulin or slowing digestion.

### Insulin Therapy

Insulin therapy is essential for managing type 1 diabetes and is often necessary for people with type 2 diabetes.

- **Types of Insulin:** Different types of insulin vary in how quickly and how long they control blood sugar. These include rapid-acting, short-acting, intermediate-acting, and long-acting insulin.
- **Administration Methods:** Insulin can be administered through syringes, insulin pens, insulin pumps, or rapid-acting inhaled insulin.

### Diet and Exercise

A healthy diet and regular physical activity are foundational for managing diabetes effectively.

- **Diet:** Focus on a balanced diet with fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Monitor carbohydrate intake and avoid sugary beverages and high-fat, processed foods.
- **Exercise:** Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity most days, like walking, swimming, or cycling, and include strength training exercises to improve insulin sensitivity and metabolism.

## Complications

Diabetes can lead to a range of complications. Managing blood sugar levels effectively is crucial to prevent or delay these complications.

### Severe Hypoglycemia

- **Hypoglycemia** occurs when **blood sugar levels drop too low**, often due to excessive insulin or missing meals.
- Symptoms include **shakiness**, **confusion**, **sweating**, and in severe cases, **seizures** or **loss of consciousness**.
- Immediate treatment with glucose or emergency medical intervention is required.

### Cardiovascular Issues

- People with diabetes are at higher risk for **cardiovascular diseases**, including heart attack, stroke, and atherosclerosis (narrowing of arteries).
- Managing blood pressure and [cholesterol levels](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/cholesterol#cholesterol-levels-by-age-and-sex), along with regular exercise, can help mitigate these risks.

### Neuropathy, Nephropathy, Retinopathy

- **Neuropathy:** Damage to nerves, particularly in **the legs and feet**, causing **pain**, [**tingling**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/tingling-in-lower-legs), or **loss of sensation**.
- **Nephropathy:** Kidney damage that can lead to **kidney failure**, requiring dialysis or transplant.
- **Retinopathy:** Eye damage that can lead to **blindness** if not managed properly.

### Foot Conditions and Skin Infections

- Poor blood flow and nerve damage increase the risk of **foot ulcers and infections**, which can lead to amputation if not treated.
- Regular foot care and prompt treatment of any injuries are essential to prevent severe outcomes.
