## What are STIs?

Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), also known as sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), are infections that are primarily spread through sexual contact, although they can also be spread through other means.

According to the [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/sexually-transmitted-infections-(stis)?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwhvi0BhA4EiwAX25ujy8VEW8GpI53ieJf3SvodWs4rsFMA1Rl7_vTlNsOY3hHTCzUAEWN5xoCkkoQAvD_BwE), every day, over **1 million** curable sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are acquired worldwide by individuals aged **15–49**, with most cases showing no symptoms.

Some STIs can cause symptoms like unusual discharge, genital sores, and itching. Mayo Clinic [states](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sexually-transmitted-diseases-stds/in-depth/std-symptoms/art-20047081) that some STIs cause mild or no symptoms but can still spread to others. There are various types of STDs, each with its own characteristics and health impacts.

### Most Common STDs

- **[Chlamydia](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/STDs-non-sexual-transmission#can-you-get-chlamydia-without-having-sex):** Chlamydia is often asymptomatic, meaning many people may not realize they are infected. It can remain [dormant for years](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/how-long-can-chlamydia-be-dormant). If left untreated, it can cause serious reproductive issues, such as infertility in women and epididymitis in men.
- **[Gonorrhea](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/STDs-non-sexual-transmission#can-you-get-gonorrhea-without-sex):** Gonorrhea can infect the genitals, rectum, and throat. It often presents with symptoms like painful urination and abnormal discharge. Untreated gonorrhea can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women and infertility in both genders.
- **[Syphilis](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/STDs-non-sexual-transmission#can-you-get-syphilis-without-having-sex):** Syphilis has distinct stages, beginning with sores at the infection site. If untreated, it can progress to severe health issues affecting the heart, brain, and other organs. Early detection and treatment are crucial.
- **HIV/AIDS:** HIV is a virus that attacks the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to other infections and certain cancers. Without treatment, HIV can progress to AIDS, which is life-threatening.
- **[Human Papillomavirus](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/STDs-non-sexual-transmission#can-you-get-hpv-without-having-sex) ( [HPV](https://docus.ai/tags/hpv)):** HPV can cause genital warts and is associated with various cancers, such as cervical cancer. Many people with HPV do not show symptoms, but vaccination can prevent the most harmful strains.
- **[Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/STDs-non-sexual-transmission#how-is-herpes-transmitted-non-sexually):** HSV causes oral and genital herpes, characterized by periodic outbreaks of sores. While there is no cure, antiviral medications can help manage symptoms and reduce transmission risk.
- **[Hepatitis B](https://www.docus.ai/symptoms-guide/hepatitis#types-of-hepatitis):** Hepatitis B affects the liver and can lead to chronic liver disease, liver cancer, or liver failure. It is preventable through vaccination, and early detection can help manage the infection and prevent serious complications.

## How STDs Are Transmitted

Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) can be spread through various methods both **sexual** and **non-sexual**. Understanding these transmission methods is crucial for prevention and maintaining sexual health.

### Sexual Transmission

- **Vaginal and Anal Intercourse:** STDs such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV, and herpes are commonly transmitted through vaginal and anal sex. These activities involve the exchange of bodily fluids, which can carry infectious agents. Using condoms and other barrier methods can significantly reduce the risk of transmission but not entirely eliminate it.
- **Oral Sex:** Oral sex can also transmit various STDs, including chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and herpes. The exchange of bodily fluids during oral sex can introduce infections to the throat and mouth. To reduce the risk, using barriers like dental dams and condoms during oral sex is recommended.
- **Genital Touching:** Direct genital contact, even without penetration, can transmit STDs. Infections such as herpes and HPV can spread through skin-to-skin contact. Practicing good hygiene and avoiding contact with sores or warts can help prevent transmission.
- **Sharing Sex Toys:** Unwashed sex toys can pass STDs between users. Infections like chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis can be transmitted through contaminated sex toys. It is important to clean sex toys thoroughly between uses and consider using condoms on sex toys to prevent the spread of infections.

### Non-Sexual Transmission

STDs can also be transmitted through non-sexual means.

- **Kissing:** Herpes and other infections can be transmitted through kissing, especially if one person has active sores. HSV-1, which causes oral herpes, can be spread by direct contact with an infected person’s saliva. Avoiding kissing when sores are present can help prevent transmission. However, not all STDs can be transmitted through kissing. For example, HIV or [chlamydia cannot be spread through saliva](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/chlamydia-from-kissing) and, therefore, cannot be transmitted by kissing.
- **Sharing Personal Items:** Sharing items such as toothbrushes, razors, or needles can pose a risk of transmitting bloodborne infections like HIV, Hepatitis B, and [Hepatitis C](https://www.docus.ai/symptoms-guide/hepatitis#types-of-hepatitis). To minimize risk, avoid using another person’s personal items, especially those that may come into contact with blood.
- **Blood Transfusions:** Blood transfusions can carry risks, particularly in countries with less stringent screening processes. Infections such as HIV and Hepatitis B can be transmitted through contaminated blood. Ensuring blood is screened and opting for safe transfusion practices can mitigate these risks.
- **Contaminated Food and Water:** Infections like [Hepatitis A](https://www.docus.ai/symptoms-guide/hepatitis#types-of-hepatitis) can be transmitted through contaminated food and water. This is more common in areas with poor sanitation. Additionally, oral-anal contact can spread infections if fecal matter enters the mouth during activities such as rimming.
- **Skin-to-Skin Contact:** Infections like HPV and herpes can be spread through skin contact. HPV, which causes genital warts, can be transmitted through physical contact with a wart. Good hygiene and avoiding contact with infected areas can help prevent the spread of these infections.
- **Childbirth:** Boston Children's Hospital [notes](https://www.childrenshospital.org/conditions/std) that some STDs, such as HIV, syphilis, and herpes, can be transmitted from mother to baby **during childbirth**. This is known as vertical transmission. For example, [CDC data](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7246e1.htm?s_cid=mm7246e1_w) show that over **3,700 babies** were born with syphilis in 2022, a figure more than ten times higher than in 2012.

Knowing the STD transmission ways is crucial for making informed decisions and supporting a healthy lifestyle.

## Prevention and Testing

Preventing STIs involves a combination of practices and lifestyle choices. Here are some effective measures you can take:

- **Use Barrier Methods:** Condoms, dental dams, and other barrier methods can significantly reduce the risk of STI transmission during vaginal, anal, and oral sex. Ensure that you use them correctly every time you engage in sexual activity.
- **Practice Good Hygiene:** Wash your hands and genital area before and after sexual activity. Avoid sharing personal items like towels, razors, and sex toys without proper cleaning.
- **Get Vaccinated:** Vaccines are available for certain STIs, such as HPV and Hepatitis B. Getting vaccinated can provide long-term protection against these infections.
- **Limit Sexual Partners:** Reducing the number of sexual partners can lower your risk of exposure to STIs. Consider maintaining a monogamous relationship with a partner who has tested negative for STIs.
- **Communicate with Partners:** Have open and honest conversations with your sexual partners about STI testing, sexual history, and safe sex practices. This communication helps establish trust and mutual responsibility for sexual health.
- **Avoid Risky Behaviors:** Refrain from sharing needles or engaging in activities that involve contact with blood or bodily fluids.
- **Regular Testing:** As emphasized earlier, regular STI testing is essential. Utilize online tools like the Symptom Checker to help identify potential symptoms and seek professional medical advice if needed.

### Regular Testing

Regular STI testing is crucial for maintaining your sexual health and preventing the spread of infections. It is recommended that sexually active individuals get tested at least once a year. Regular testing helps detect STIs early, often before symptoms appear, making it easier to treat the infection and prevent complications.

_Testing Recommendations from the [CDC](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/sexually-transmitted-infections-stis/)_:

**General Population:**

- **Ages 13 to 64:** Test for HIV at least once a year.

**Women:**

- **Under 25 years:** Annual testing for gonorrhea and chlamydia.
- **25 years and older:** Annual testing for gonorrhea and chlamydia if they have new partners, multiple partners, or a partner with an STI.

**Pregnant Individuals:**

- **Early in pregnancy:** Test for syphilis, HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C.
- **At risk:** Also test for chlamydia and gonorrhea early in pregnancy, with possible repeat testing.

**Sexually Active Men Who Are Gay, Bisexual, or Have Sex with Men:**

- **Syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea:** At least once a year; more frequently (every 3-6 months) if multiple or anonymous partners.
- **HIV:** At least once a year; possibly every 3-6 months for increased benefit.
- **Hepatitis C:** At least once a year if living with HIV.

**Injection Drug Users:**

- Test for HIV at least once a year.

**Oral or Anal Sex Practitioners:**

- Consult with a healthcare provider about throat and rectal testing options.

By following these preventive measures, you can significantly reduce your risk of contracting and spreading STIs. Taking proactive steps to protect your sexual health is crucial for your well-being and that of your partners.

## Addressing Common Myths

There are many misconceptions about STI transmission that can lead to unnecessary fear or risky behaviors. Let’s debunk some of the most common myths with scientific evidence.

- **Myth: You Can Get an STI from a Toilet Seat**
  - **Fact:** The likelihood of contracting an STI from a toilet seat is extremely low. Most STIs cannot survive long outside the human body, especially on cold, hard surfaces like toilet seats. Transmission requires direct contact with infected body fluids or skin.
- **Myth: Public Pools and Hot Tubs Can Spread STIs**
  - **Fact:** Public pools and hot tubs are not common sources of STI transmission. The chlorine and other chemicals used in pools and hot tubs kill most pathogens that cause STIs. Additionally, STIs require close and direct contact for transmission.
- **Myth: Only People with Symptoms Can Spread STIs**
  - **Fact:** Many STIs can be asymptomatic, meaning individuals may not show any signs or symptoms but can still transmit the infection. This is why regular testing is so important, as it helps detect and treat infections that might otherwise go unnoticed.
- **Myth: Oral Sex is Completely Safe**
  - **Fact:** While the risk of transmitting STIs through oral sex is lower than through vaginal or anal sex, it is still possible to contract infections like gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, and herpes through oral-genital contact. Using condoms or dental dams can reduce this risk.
- **Myth: STIs Are Not a Concern in Long-Term Relationships**
  - **Fact:** Even in long-term, monogamous relationships, it’s important to consider STI testing and safe sex practices. Previous infections, infidelity, or past partners can all be potential sources of STIs. Regular testing and open communication are key to maintaining sexual health in any relationship.

This information can promote a better understanding of STI transmission and encourage safer practices. It's important to stay informed and take proactive steps to protect your health and the health of your partners.
