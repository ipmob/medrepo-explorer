A recent [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37395124/) found that women may gain about **0.5 kilograms (approximately 1 pound)** during their period, and here’s the thing—it’s not fat.

The extra weight comes from water retention, bloating, and even a little digestive slowdown. It’s your body doing its thing, and it’s nothing to stress about.

The best part? This weight usually disappears a few days after your period starts. Once your hormones stabilize, you’ll feel back to normal.

So, don’t let the scale get to you—it’s just temporary.

## What Causes Weight Gain During Your Period?

Gaining a few pounds during your period is totally normal— it’s not about fat. Here’s what’s going on behind the scenes.

### Hormonal Fluctuations

Hormones are the big players here.

Right before your period, [estrogen](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/estrogen) and [progesterone](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/progesterone) levels drop fast. This sudden change tells your body to hold on to extra water—kind of like a sponge.

That’s why you might feel puffier around your stomach, breasts, or even your hands and feet. It’s called **water retention**, and while it’s annoying, it’s not permanent. Once your hormones settle, that extra water weight will flush right out.

### Bloating and Gastrointestinal Changes

[Bloating](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/period-bloating) is another unwelcome visitor during your period. Hormones can slow down digestion, causing your stomach to feel full and tight.

Gas buildup or even [constipation](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/constipation-during-periods) might make matters worse.

And let’s not forget cramps—those annoying contractions in your uterus can leave you feeling heavy and uncomfortable. It’s like your body is putting on a show, and you’re the unlucky audience.

### Food Cravings and Overeating

[Craving chocolate](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/chocolate-crave-on-period) or devouring an entire bag of chips in one sitting? Thank your hormones for that too.

When [serotonin](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/serotonin) levels drop (that’s the feel-good hormone), your body starts screaming for quick fixes like sweets and carbs. These foods give you a serotonin boost.

_“If you give in to those cravings and you're eating a lot of salty foods your body's gonna retain water and you're gonna feel bloated and you're gonna notice on the scale that you've gained weight. It just happens…”_, [says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBMABayqtVc) Dr. Holly Mehr MD, MSEd, FACOG double board certified in Reproductive Endocrinology and Obstetrics and Gynecology for People.

While giving in to cravings isn’t the end of the world, a little moderation can help you avoid feeling sluggish later.

_“Everybody always thinks that they're gaining weight overnight and that I just have to tell you its physiologically impossible._

_It takes 3500 calories to put on a pound. So unless you're literally eating 10000 calories in one sitting you're not actually gaining 2 or 3 pounds in one day”,_ continues Dr. Mehr.

### Reduced Physical Activity

Let’s be real—when cramps hit, working out is the last thing you want to do. It’s so much easier to curl up on the couch and binge your favorite show.

But skipping workouts can make you feel even more weighed down, especially if you’ve been giving in to those cravings.

### Magnesium and Hydration Imbalances

[Magnesium](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/magnesium) levels in your body naturally decrease as your body prepares for the period. Since magnesium helps regulate hydration and cravings, low levels can make your body feel dehydrated, even if you’re drinking water.

Dehydration can sometimes mimic hunger, causing you to eat more than necessary. Plus, low magnesium can trigger a sweet tooth, so if you’ve been eyeing that chocolate bar, now you know why.

## Tips to Manage Period-Related Weight Gain

Feeling like your body has its own agenda during your period? Don’t worry—there are simple ways to manage that temporary weight gain and feel more comfortable. Here are some practical tips to help:

- **Stay Hydrated**: It might sound paradoxical, but drinking plenty of water can actually reduce water retention. When your body is well-hydrated, it’s less likely to hold onto extra fluids.
- **Eat Fiber-Rich Foods**: Foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help with digestion and ease bloating or constipation. Bonus: They keep you feeling fuller for longer!
- **Choose Complex Carbs**: Craving something sweet? Go for complex carbs like sweet potatoes, oats, or quinoa. They help stabilize blood sugar levels and keep those cravings in check.
- **Exercise Regularly**: Even if you’re not up for a full workout, light activity like walking, yoga, or stretching can boost circulation, flash out the salt from your body, ease bloating, and lift your mood.
- **Include Magnesium-Rich Foods**: Add foods like nuts, spinach, and dark chocolate to your meals.

Small changes like these can make a big difference in how you feel during your cycle. Try a few and see what works best for you!

## Frequently Asked Questions

### \#\#\# Do you tend to weigh more before or after your period?

Most people experience weight gain in the days leading up to their period due to hormonal changes, water retention, and bloating. This extra weight usually subsides as your period progresses and your hormones stabilize.

### \#\#\# When is your weight at its lowest during your cycle?

Your weight is often at its lowest during the follicular phase of your cycle, which begins right after your period. Hormonal balance during this time can reduce bloating and cravings.

### \#\#\# Is it normal to eat more during your period?

It’s completely normal to feel hungrier during your period. Hormonal fluctuations can increase appetite and cravings, especially for high-carb or salty foods. Listening to your body and choosing nourishing options can help maintain balance.

## Conclusion

Period weight gain is natural and temporary, mainly caused by hormonal changes, water retention, and cravings. Simple habits like staying hydrated and eating balanced meals can ease symptoms.

Remember, the extra weight usually goes away after your period ends, so don’t stress—it’s just a phase!
