**Quick Answer:** _**No, constipation itself doesn’t cause a fever**_. However, when constipation and fever appear together, it’s often due to an underlying issue, like an infection, digestive blockage, or conditions such as diverticulitis or appendicitis.

It is important to find the main cause of these symptoms for effective treatment, especially in children.

## What Is Constipation?

Constipation is a common digestive issue that makes it difficult to pass stool. It occurs when bowel movements become less frequent and stools become hard and dry. This condition can affect people of all ages, from infants to the elderly.

### Symptoms

Constipation symptoms can vary from person to person, but the most common signs include:

- Infrequent bowel movements (fewer than [three per week](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/constipation#:~:text=Constipation%20is%20a%20condition%20in,than%20three%20times%20a%20week.))
- Hard or lumpy stools
- Straining during bowel movements
- A feeling of incomplete emptying after a bowel movement
- Abdominal pain or bloating

These symptoms may be mild or severe, depending on the underlying cause and duration of constipation.

### Causes

Constipation can result from various factors, common causes include:

- **Low Fiber Intake:** Not enough fruits, vegetables, and whole grains in the diet can lead to hard stools.
- [**Dehydration**](https://docus.ai/tags/hydration) **:** Too little water intake can cause stools to become dry and hard to pass.
- **Lack of Physical Activity:** A sedentary lifestyle can slow down digestion and contribute to constipation.
- **Ignoring the Urge:** Delayed bowel movements can cause the stool to harden, making it more difficult to pass.
- **Changes in Routine:** [Travel](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/travel-constipation), stress, or changes in eating habits can disrupt regular bowel movements.
- **Medications:** Some pain relievers, antacids, and antidepressants can cause constipation as a side effect.
- **Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders:** Conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) can affect how the intestines function, leading to constipation.
- **Pelvic Floor Disorders:** Problems with the muscles involved in bowel movements can make it difficult to pass stool, leading to chronic constipation.
- **Celiac Disease:** This autoimmune disorder affects the digestive system and can lead to constipation as the body reacts to gluten.
- **Diverticular Disease:** Inflammation or infection of small pouches (diverticula) in the digestive tract can result in changes to bowel habits, including constipation.
- **Hormonal Conditions:** Conditions that affect hormone levels, such as [diabetes](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/diabetes), [thyroid diseases](https://docus.ai/tags/thyroid-issues), and pregnancy, can slow down the digestive process.
- **Neurological Conditions:** Diseases that affect the nervous system, such as Parkinson’s disease or multiple sclerosis, can cause constipation.

## What Is Fever?

Fever is a temporary rise in body temperature above the normal **[98.6°F (37°C)](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001982.htm#:~:text=The%20average%20normal%20body%20temperature,F%20(37%C2%B0C).)**. It often indicates that the body is fighting an infection.

A fever is not always dangerous, but it can be a sign of a serious condition. It is a common symptom in many illnesses, acting as a natural defense mechanism.

### Common Causes of Fever

Several factors can cause a fever:

- **Infections:** Viral or bacterial infections, such as the flu or a cold, are common causes. The body raises its temperature to help fight off these infections.
- **Inflammation:** Conditions like [arthritis](https://docus.ai/tags/arthritis) or other inflammatory diseases can trigger a rise in body temperature.
- **Heat Exhaustion:** Excessive time in high temperatures or physical exertion in the heat can lead to a fever.
- **Vaccinations:** [Some vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/basics/possible-side-effects.html) may cause a mild fever as the body builds immunity.
- **Medications:** Certain drugs ( _antibiotics_, _cardiovascular drugs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and salicylates, histamine type 2 blockers, anticonvulsants, and psychotropic drugs_) can cause a fever as a side effect or allergic reaction.

## Can Constipation Cause Fever?

**Constipation does not directly cause fever**, but certain underlying conditions can cause both symptoms to appear at the same time:

### Intestinal Obstruction

Severe constipation can lead to a blockage in the intestines. This blockage can cause pain, swelling, and sometimes fever, as the body reacts to the obstruction.

### Diverticulitis

Inflammation or infection of small pouches ( **diverticula**) in the digestive tract can lead to both constipation and fever. When these pouches become blocked or infected, it may cause pain, fever, and changes in bowel habits, including constipation.

Diverticulitis often requires antibiotics or, in severe cases, surgery to treat the infection and relieve symptoms.

### Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)

Conditions like **Crohn’s disease** and **ulcerative colitis** involve chronic inflammation of the digestive tract.

These inflammatory bowel diseases can cause a range of symptoms, including constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever.

### Appendicitis

[Appendicitis](https://docus.ai/tags/appendicitis) is an inflammation of the appendix, a small pouch attached to the large intestine.

Early symptoms can sometimes include constipation or difficulty passing gas. Therefore, appendicitis is often missed in the early stages.

As the inflammation worsens, it can cause severe abdominal pain, usually in the lower right side, and a high fever.

### Gastrointestinal Infections

Gastrointestinal infections, like **gastroenteritis**, can upset the digestive system. They cause inflammation and pain, which slow digestion and lead to constipation.

At the same time, the body’s immune response to the infection can cause a fever as it fights off the invading bacteria or viruses.

### Medications

Certain medications may lead to both constipation and an increase in body temperature as potential side effects.

In some cases, _**constipation and fever may appear together without a direct connection**_. For example, someone might have constipation from a low-fiber diet and also get a cold or flu that causes a fever. These conditions can coexist but remain unrelated to each other.

## Constipation and Fever in Infants and Children

Constipation and fever often raise concerns when they occur together in infants and young children. Their bodies respond differently to digestive issues and infections, making it crucial for parents to understand what might be happening and when to seek medical help.

### Common Causes in Infants

Constipation in infants often occurs during key developmental stages, such as **transitioning to solid foods** or **changing from breast milk to formula**. This change may lead to harder stools and less frequent bowel movements.

Constipated infants may strain, arch their back, or cry during bowel movements due to the discomfort.

**Note**: _It is common for infants to appear to strain during a bowel movement, but if they pass a soft stool afterward, it may not indicate true constipation._

Fever in infants may signal an infection, such as a **cold**, **flu**, or other viral and bacterial infections. [Urinary tract infections](https://docus.ai/tags/uti) (UTIs) are also common sources of fever, especially in girls.

Additionally, fevers in babies can result from more benign causes, such as a reaction to a recent vaccination or overheating on a warm day.

If constipation and fever appear together, it may indicate a more serious issue, such as a digestive infection or, rarely, an intestinal blockage.

Parents should consult a healthcare provider if the baby’s fever persists or if they appear uncomfortable or in pain.

![child with constipation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2Fe8b93bfc1008b7f27a1b0cbdc00d76bc.png&w=3840&q=100)

### Common Causes in Children

Constipation in children is usually **functional**, without an organic cause ( [about 95% of all cases](https://www.albertahealthservices.ca/assets/about/scn/ahs-scn-dh-pathway-pediatric-constipation.pdf)). Children may experience constipation due to a low-fiber diet, insufficient fluid intake, or avoiding bathroom breaks.

Dr. Michael Wilsey, a specialist in pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition at Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital, [says](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/dealing-with-kids-and-constipation):

“ _In children, constipation often results from changes in the diet or routine, during toilet training, or after an illness. Anything that gets children out of their normal routine can affect their stooling routine. Occasionally, children may stool withhold when they are reluctant to use unfamiliar toilet facilities. This occurs more commonly in school-age children_.”

Some children may hold in their bowel movements if they fear pain or feel embarrassed to use public toilets at school, worsening constipation over time.

A child with constipation might have fewer bowel movements than usual, passing hard or painful stools, or avoiding the toilet altogether.

If a child experiences both constipation and fever, it may be due to conditions like **appendicitis**, **severe infections**, or **inflammatory bowel disease**.

Appendicitis, for example, may initially present as constipation before fever and severe abdominal pain develop. In such cases, prompt medical attention is crucial.

Fever in children can also result from infections like the flu, respiratory illnesses, or stomach bugs.

## When to Seek Help

Constipation and fever can sometimes resolve with home care, but certain situations require medical attention.

It is important to consult a doctor if any of the following signs occur:

- [Persistent fever](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/when-to-go-to-the-hospital-for-fever) lasting more than 24 hours without improvement.
- High fever above 102°F (39°C), which may indicate a serious infection.
- Refusal to eat or drink, which can lead to dehydration.
- A swollen or hard abdomen.
- Severe pain, especially in the lower right side of the abdomen.
- Additions symptoms, such as blood in the stool, vomiting, dizziness, signs of dehydration, and weight loss.
- Rapid heart rate or breathing, which can be signs of severe dehydration or a systemic infection.
- Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, especially when accompanied by other symptoms, may indicate a more severe underlying issue.

## Diagnosing Constipation and Fever

Proper diagnosis is important when constipation and fever occur together, especially in children. A healthcare provider will take a detailed medical history, and ask about bowel habits, diet, and other symptoms like pain or vomiting.

To understand the cause, the doctor may suggest tests such as abdominal **X-rays** to identify blockages or large amounts of stool. **[Blood tests](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview)** can reveal signs of infection or inflammation and **stool samples** can detect digestive infections. An **ultrasound** is important for detecting conditions like appendicitis or identifying structural issues in the digestive tract.

A consultation with a **gastroenterologist** may be necessary if symptoms persist or become severe. Specialized evaluations like colonoscopy or a colorectal transit study can help diagnose more complex conditions.

## Treatment for Constipation and Fever

Treating constipation and fever depends on their causes. For mild cases, home remedies and lifestyle adjustments often provide relief. However, specific conditions like appendicitis or diverticulitis require more intensive treatment, such as antibiotics or surgery.

### Managing Constipation

- **Increase Fiber Intake:** Foods rich in fiber, such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, help soften stools and improve bowel movements.
- **Stay Hydrated:** Adequate water intake helps prevent stools from becoming dry and hard, making them easier to pass.
- **Encourage Physical Activity:** Light exercises, such as walking, can stimulate bowel movements and support digestive health.
- **Consider Over-the-Counter Options:** Stool softeners or laxatives may be helpful if dietary changes are insufficient. _Consult a healthcare provider before using these to prevent dependency and address the root cause._

A healthy diet rich in fiber and fluids, along with regular physical activity, not only help manage constipation but also play a key role in preventing it.

### Managing Fever

- **Rest and Hydration:** Fluids like water, clear broths, or electrolyte solutions help prevent dehydration during a fever.
- **Use Fever-Reducing Medications:** Over-the-counter options like acetaminophen or ibuprofen can reduce fever discomfort. Follow dosage guidelines based on age and weight.

### Treatment Options for Infants and Children

Infants and children need special care when dealing with constipation and fever. Pureed fruits like **prunes** or **pears** can help ease constipation.

For babies, adequate breast milk or formula intake helps prevent dehydration. Older children may benefit from increased fiber and water, as well as a regular toilet routine.

For managing fever in infants, consult a pediatrician before giving any medication, as dosages vary with age.

It is important to monitor the child's comfort and temperature closely. Seek medical attention if the fever persists beyond 24 hours or if the child shows signs of severe discomfort or lethargy.
