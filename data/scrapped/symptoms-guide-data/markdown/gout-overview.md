## What is Gout?

**Gout** is a **type of arthritis** that causes sudden, severe joint pain. It commonly affects the big toe but can impact other joints like [ankles](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/gout-in-ankle), [knees](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/gout-in-knee), [hands](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/gout-in-hand), and [elbows](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/gout-in-elbow). Gout results from an excess of [uric acid](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/uric-acid) in the blood. Gout attacks, also known as flares, can occur suddenly and are characterized by pain, redness, and swelling in the affected joint.

Gout is more common in men, particularly as they age, but women can also develop it, especially after [menopause](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/about-menopause).

A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10285625/) in JMIR Public Health Surveillance reveals that the global incidence of gout has **surged by 65% over the last 20 years**. Additionally, while the male-to-female ratio of gout incidence has stayed steady at **3:1**, the incidence has risen in both genders over time.

## Symptoms and Duration of Gout

### Common Symptoms

Gout symptoms can appear suddenly and are often severe. They typically affect **one joint** at a time, but multiple joints can be involved. The common symptoms of gout include:

- **Sudden Severe Pain:** This is usually the first sign of a gout attack. The [pain often starts at night](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/how-to-stop-gout-pain-at-night) and can be so intense that even the weight of a bed sheet can feel unbearable.
- **Swelling and Redness:** The affected joint becomes swollen, red, and warm to the touch. The inflammation can make the joint appear larger than normal.
- **Tenderness:** The joint is extremely sensitive, and even the slightest touch can cause severe pain.

To detect gout symptoms, you can use the [Docus Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker) to explore potential conditions. However, it is crucial to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and a personalized treatment plan.

### Duration of Gout Attacks

Gout attacks, or flares, typically last for **a few days to a week or two** if untreated. The pain is most severe in the **first 24 hours**, gradually lessening as the days pass.

Some people may experience lingering discomfort for **several weeks** after the severe pain subsides. Over time, gout attacks can become more frequent and last longer if not properly managed.

## Causes of Gout

### Uric Acid Buildup

Uric acid is a natural waste product formed when the body breaks down purines, which are substances found in certain foods and drinks, as well as in human cells. Normally, uric acid dissolves in the blood and is excreted through the kidneys into the urine.

However, if the body produces too much uric acid or the kidneys do not excrete enough, uric acid levels in the blood can become elevated. This condition is known as **hyperuricemia**. When hyperuricemia occurs, uric acid can form sharp, needle-like crystals in the joints, causing intense pain and inflammation associated with gout.

### Dietary Factors

Diet plays a significant role in the development of gout. Consuming foods **high in purines** can increase uric acid levels in the body, leading to gout attacks. Foods that are particularly high in purines include:

- **Red Meat and Seafood:** For example, beef, lamb, and pork, anchovies, sardines, mussels, scallops, trout, and tuna. A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3226107/#:~:text=Increased%20meat%20and%20seafood%20intake,vegetables%20or%20total%20protein%20intake.) from Arthritis Research & Therapy found that consuming more meat and seafood increases the risk of developing gout by approximately 1.4 times and 1.5 times, respectively.
- **Organ Meats:** Liver, kidneys, and sweetbreads.
- **Sugary Drinks:** Beverages sweetened with high fructose corn syrup, which can increase uric acid production.

Reducing the intake of these high-purine foods and beverages can help lower uric acid levels and reduce the risk of gout attacks.

### Medical Conditions and Medications

Certain medical conditions and medications can also contribute to elevated uric acid levels and the development of gout. Conditions that increase the risk include:

- **Obesity:** Excess body weight increases the production of uric acid and reduces its elimination by the kidneys.
- **Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)**: This can impair kidney function, leading to higher uric acid levels.
- [**Diabetes**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/diabetes) **:** Poor [insulin](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/insulin) regulation affects uric acid metabolism.
- [**Kidney Disease**](https://docus.ai/tags/kidney-diseases) **:** Impaired kidney function reduces the body's ability to excrete uric acid.

Medications that can elevate uric acid levels include **diuretics** (water pills), which are often used to treat high blood pressure, and some drugs used to treat heart conditions.

### Genetic Factors

Genetics also play a role in the likelihood of developing gout. A study published in [Hereditas](https://hereditasjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41065-022-00243-y) indicates that approximately 73% of the variation in hyperuricemia and gout is due to genetic factors.

Additionally, about **40% to 50%** of individuals with gout **report a family history of the condition**. If you have a family history of gout, you are at a higher risk of developing the condition yourself. Genetic predisposition affects how the body processes and excretes uric acid.

**Note:** _If your parents or grandparents had gout, it is important to be mindful of your uric acid levels and take preventive measures to reduce your risk._

## Treatment Options for Gout

Effectively [gout treatment](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/10-minute-gout-relief) involves a combination of medications and lifestyle modifications aimed at alleviating symptoms and preventing future attacks.

### Medications

Managing gout effectively often involves medications to alleviate symptoms and prevent future attacks. Key medications include:

- **NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs):** These drugs reduce pain and inflammation.
- **Colchicine:** This prescription medication, approved by the [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/colchicine-marketed-colcrys-information), is effective in reducing gout pain and inflammation when taken early during an attack. ( **Caution:** _Colchicine should only be used under the prescription of a doctor_).
- **Corticosteroids:** These can be taken orally or injected into the affected joint to quickly reduce inflammation and pain.
- **Uric Acid-Lowering Drugs:** These help lower uric acid levels in the blood, preventing future attacks.

Always consult a healthcare provider before starting or changing any medication to ensure proper use and manage potential side effects.

### Lifestyle Changes

Lifestyle modifications are essential for managing gout and reducing the frequency of attacks. Key changes include:

- **Dietary Adjustments:** Reducing the intake of purine-rich foods helps lower uric acid levels. Focus on eating fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products.
- **Hydration:** Drinking plenty of water helps flush uric acid from the body, preventing crystal formation in the joints.
- **Weight Management:** Maintaining a healthy weight reduces stress on the joints and helps control uric acid levels. Avoid crash diets, as rapid weight loss can increase uric acid.

## When to See a Doctor

It is important to seek medical attention if you experience sudden, intense joint pain, especially if the pain is accompanied by swelling and redness. You should consult a doctor if:

- **First-time Symptoms:** You have symptoms of gout for the first time.
- **Worsening Symptoms:** Your usual gout treatments are not effective, and the pain is worsening.
- **Severe Symptoms:** You have a high fever, feel hot and shivery, or cannot eat, which could indicate an infection in the joint.

Ignoring these symptoms can lead to more severe complications, such as joint damage. Therefore, timely medical intervention is crucial.

## Complications of Gout

### Chronic Gout

If gout is left untreated, it can lead to chronic gout, which poses several risks:

- **Development of Tophi:** Chronic gout can cause tophi to develop. These are hard, uric acid crystal deposits that form under the skin and can appear on the fingers, toes, elbows, and ears. Tophi can cause joint damage and lead to chronic arthritis.
- **Joint Damage:** Repeated gout attacks can cause permanent damage to the joints, leading to chronic pain and loss of function.

### Other Health Risks

Untreated gout can also lead to other serious health issues:

- **Kidney Stones:** Uric acid crystals can accumulate in the kidneys, forming kidney stones. These stones can cause severe pain and may require medical intervention.
- **Cardiovascular Issues:** High uric acid levels have been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension and heart disease. Managing gout and maintaining healthy uric acid levels can help reduce this risk.
