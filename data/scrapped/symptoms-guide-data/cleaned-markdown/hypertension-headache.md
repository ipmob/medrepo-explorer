## What Is a Hypertension Headache?

A ** hypertension headache ** is a specific type of headache triggered by high blood pressure.

High blood pressure is called a "silent killer" because it usually has no symptoms. However, during a ** hypertensive crisis **(blood pressure of 180/120 mm Hg or higher), a headache can occur.

It may also happen in people with newly diagnosed hypertension, even when blood pressure readings are moderately elevated, such as 140/80 mm Hg.

## Why Does High Blood Pressure Cause Headaches?

When blood pressure rises sharply, it stresses the blood vessels in your brain. This extra strain can cause pain.

But not all headaches in people with high blood pressure are directly caused by the condition. High blood pressure can indirectly contribute to headaches. Other factors can play a role, such as:

-** Medication Side Effects **: Some blood pressure medications, like [calcium channel blockers](https: //www. mayoclinic. org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/in-depth/calcium-channel-blockers/art-20047605#: ~: text=Calcium%20channel%20blockers%20are%20medicines, arteries%20to%20squeeze%20more%20strongly.), can cause headaches as a side effect. Doctor may recommend to change the medication.
- [Obstructive Sleep Apnea](https: //www. mayoclinic. org/diseases-conditions/obstructive-sleep-apnea/symptoms-causes/syc-20352090#: ~: text=Obstructive%20sleep%20apnea%20occurs%20when, breathing%20is%20momentarily%20cut%20off.)**(OSA)**: OSA interrupts breathing during sleep, reducing oxygen levels and causing blood pressure spikes. This can also lead to morning headaches. Treating OSA can help reduce these headaches.
-** Stress and Anxiety **: Stress can raise blood pressure temporarily. This spike may trigger tension headaches or worsen existing ones.

Recognizing these triggers can help identify what’s causing your headache. It’s not always just high blood pressure.

## What Does a High Blood Pressure Headache Feel Like?

This type of headache has distinct characteristics. Here’s what to expect:

-** Throbbing or pulsating pain ** that may feel like a heartbeat in your head.
-** Pressure-like sensations **, often felt behind the eyes or in the temples.
- Pain that may worsen during physical activity or with stress.

A ** hypertension headache ** can occur in various parts of the head, including the back of the head, but its location can vary from person to person.

Unlike regular headaches, these symptoms often come with other signs of high blood pressure, such as dizziness, shortness of breath, blurry vision, or flashing lights in the eyes.

-* Note: ** _Always check your blood pressure, even if you don’t have a history of hypertension. High blood pressure can develop silently, without noticeable symptoms. _

A ** headache from high blood pressure ** isn’t just uncomfortable—it can be dangerous. Ignoring it can lead to severe complications, such as:

-** Stroke **: Extremely high blood pressure can rupture or block brain blood vessels.
-** Heart Attack **: Prolonged high pressure puts stress on the heart.

These risks highlight the importance of addressing hypertension headaches promptly.

## How To Prevent Hypertension Headaches?

Prevention focuses on controlling blood pressure. Try these practical tips:

-** Eat a heart-healthy diet **: Reduce salt and increase potassium by eating fruits and vegetables.
-** Exercise regularly **: Aim for 30 minutes of moderate activity most days of the week.
-** Manage stress **: Practice relaxation techniques like yoga or deep breathing.

Small, consistent changes can significantly reduce your risk.
