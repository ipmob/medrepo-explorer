## Why Do You Crave Chocolate on Your Period?

### Hormonal Changes

Your menstrual cycle brings natural changes to your hormones, which can directly affect your mood and appetite.

- During the ** luteal phase **(the days leading up to your period), ** progesterone ** levels increase,  to prepare the uterine lining for potential pregnancy. It makes you feel hungrier.
- Research](https: //www. frontiersin. org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2020.00311/full? utm _ source=chatgpt. com)shows that [** cortisol levels **, often called the ** stress hormone **, can rise during menstruation. Higher cortisol can make you feel more anxious or stressed, which may trigger cravings for comfort foods to help you feel calmer.
- At the same time, ** serotonin levels **—your body’s “feel-good” hormone—drop. Lower serotonin can leave you feeling low, tired, or irritable. To boost serotonin quickly, your body often craves foods that trigger its production—like chocolate!

Chocolate, especially the sugary kind, helps release ** dopamine **, a hormone that brings feelings of pleasure and satisfaction.

This combination makes chocolate a popular go-to food for comfort during this time.

### Nutritional Deficiency

Your body may also be signaling a need for certain nutrients during your period. One key nutrient is ** magnesium **. It is a mineral that helps reduce muscle cramps and support mood regulation.

- Chocolate, especially ** dark chocolate **, is naturally rich in ** magnesium **. It can help meet this need and soothe some period symptoms, like cramps and irritability.
- Chocolate contains ** calcium ** and ** copper **, which help your body produce endorphins and serotonin—two chemicals that improve mood and reduce pain naturally.

When you’re craving chocolate, your body might be instinctively seeking these nutrients to feel better.

### Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)

Did you know your body uses more energy during menstruation?

This is because your ** basal metabolic rate (BMR)**—the amount of energy your body needs to perform basic functions—** increases ** slightly.

[Research](https: //pubmed. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/12828798/)suggests that your body burns an additional ** 100 to 300 ** calories per day during the week leading up to your period.

As your body works harder to prepare for menstruation, you might feel hungrier and crave ** calorie-dense foods ** like chocolate. _"After all, a period involves shedding the womb lining which requires energy! ”_, [notes](https: //www. cosmopolitan. com/uk/body/health/a33823341/hungry-on-period/)Obstetrician-Gynecologist Dr. Henderson.

Chocolate is high in both ** carbohydrates ** and ** fats **, which provide a quick energy boost to meet these rising energy demands.

This natural rise in BMR can make cravings feel stronger and more persistent, especially when combined with hormonal changes and serotonin dips.

### Emotional Comfort

Let’s face it—PMS (Premenstrual Syndrome) and menstruation itself can be tough. Mood swings, irritability, and stress are all common symptoms that can leave you reaching for comfort foods.

Chocolate isn’t just about its nutrients; it’s also about how it makes you feel.

Eating chocolate is often associated with ** self-care ** and a moment of indulgence. It provides a quick mood boost, which can feel like a small escape during a challenging time.

The act of eating chocolate can be soothing. It’s a simple way to treat yourself when you need a little extra comfort.

## What About Other Sugary Foods?

People often crave other sweet foods for the ** same reasons ** they crave chocolate—hormonal changes, mood swings, and the need for a quick energy boost.

However, unlike chocolate, most sugary foods ** lack the additional nutrients ** that can actually help your body during this time.

Other sugary treats—like candy, pastries, or soda—may satisfy your cravings temporarily, but they don’t offer the same benefits. Instead, they provide a quick sugar rush that can lead to energy crashes or leave you feeling bloated.

## Should You Give In to Your Cravings? _“Listening to your hunger cues and appetite is always a good thing to do, as it can help us to fuel our body for the activity it is doing as well as understand when we are full, ”_[says](https: //www. bbc. co. uk/food/articles/periods)dietitian Ro Huntriss.

If you’d rather not overindulge, you can always opt for ** healthier alternatives ** that satisfy your cravings without compromising balance.

## What Are the Healthier Alternatives to Chocolate and Sugary Foods?

While chocolate and sugary snacks are tempting, there are healthier options that can satisfy your cravings ** and ** support your body during your period:

-** Fresh Fruits **: Sweet fruits like ** bananas **, ** dates **, and ** berries ** offer natural sugars for energy, plus vitamins, minerals, and fiber to keep you feeling full longer.
-** Nuts and Seeds **: Almonds, cashews, or pumpkin seeds are great snacks. They’re rich in ** healthy fats, magnesium, and protein **, which can curb cravings and provide steady energy.
