## Can You Take Vitamin C at Night?

Yes, you can take vitamin C at night.

Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is like your body’s personal repair crew.

This vitamin is ** water-soluble **, meaning your body absorbs what it needs and flushes out the rest. Unlike fat-soluble vitamins, it ** doesn’t require food or specific timing to work effectively **.

However, ** some people may want to avoid taking it before bed **:

-** If you have acid reflux or a sensitive stomach **– Vitamin C, especially in high doses, can increase stomach acidity, and lead to mild heartburn or nausea.
-** If you take high doses (above 500 mg)**– Larger amounts can cause digestive discomfort, including bloating or loose stools.
-** If you take certain medications **– Vitamin C may interact with some drugs, such as blood thinners. If unsure, consult your doctor.

If you’ve ever experienced ** nausea, heartburn, or stomach upset ** from vitamin C, you may take it ** earlier in the day or with food ** to minimize discomfort.

## Vitamin C and Sleep – Any Connection?

You might have heard that vitamin C gives an ** energy boost ** and now wonder if it disrupts sleep. But ** there’s no scientific evidence that vitamin C keeps you awake **.

In fact, research suggests vitamin C may actually support better sleep. A [study](https: //www. mdpi. com/2072-6643/16/21/3661)found that people who consumed more vitamin C had a ** lower risk of sleep disturbances **, including insomnia and sleep apnea.

Vitamin C is a ** strong **[antioxidant](https: //www. cancer. gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/antioxidant), meaning it helps protect your cells from damage. This damage can stress the body and affect sleep. By reducing this stress, vitamin C ** may help your body recover better at night ** and support more restful sleep.

Additionally, [research](https: //pmc. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/articles/PMC3703747/)found that individuals with shorter sleep durations had lower intakes of vitamin C. This suggests a potential link between adequate vitamin C consumption and healthy sleep patterns.

While more research is needed, there’s no strong evidence that Vitamin C harms sleep.
