## Frequently Asked Questions

### \#\#\# Why does a UTI hurt so bad at night?

UTI symptoms often feel worse at night because urine sits in the bladder longer, allowing bacteria to irritate the bladder lining. Hormonal fluctuations and reduced distractions also make pain and urgency more noticeable.

### \#\#\# Does sitting on the toilet help with a UTI?

Sitting on the toilet can provide temporary relief by allowing the bladder to empty fully and reducing pressure. However, frequent straining or staying on the toilet too long can increase discomfort and irritation.

### \#\#\# Can holding in urine make a UTI worse?

Yes, holding in urine allows bacteria to multiply in the bladder, increasing irritation and prolonging the infection. It’s best to urinate frequently to help flush out bacteria.

### \#\#\# Why do I still feel like I have to pee after going?

A UTI can cause bladder inflammation, leading to a constant feeling of urgency, even when your bladder is empty. This sensation may persist until the infection is treated.
