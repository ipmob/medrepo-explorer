Reviewed by

Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT) can affect your cardiovascular system in various ways. While some individuals might experience a slight rise in blood pressure, others may see no impact or even improvements in heart health.

The good news is that there are many safe ways to manage blood pressure, including lifestyle changes, regular monitoring, and working closely with your doctor.

## What Is Testosterone Therapy?

Testosterone therapy, often called TRT, helps people with low testosterone levels. It’s commonly used for men whose bodies don’t naturally produce enough of this hormone.

Low testosterone (male hypogonadism) can cause symptoms like ** fatigue **, ** low sex drive **, and ** muscle weakness **.

TRT is designed to restore testosterone levels to a healthy range, improving these symptoms and overall quality of life.

## How Does Testosterone Affect Blood Pressure?

Testosterone can change how your body manages blood pressure. It works in different ways, some of which may raise or lower your levels depending on your overall health.

### Blood Vessels

Testosterone helps blood vessels relax and widen. This can improve blood flow and lower blood pressure.

However, it may also trigger the [renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)](https: //en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Renin%E2%80%93angiotensin_system#: ~: text=The%20renin%2Dangiotensin%20system%20(RAS, balance%2C%20and%20systemic%20vascular%20resistance.), which controls blood pressure and fluid balance.

When RAAS becomes too active, blood vessels can tighten and lose flexibility, making it harder for blood to flow. This resistance increases blood pressure.

### Blood Thickness

Testosterone boosts the production of red blood cells. These cells carry oxygen to your organs and muscles, which is essential for health.

But when there are too many red blood cells, the blood becomes thicker. Thick blood moves slowly, making the heart work harder to pump it. Over time, this can lead to higher blood pressure and strain on the heart.

### Fluid Retention

Testosterone can make the body hold onto extra water and salt. This increases the amount of fluid in the bloodstream, forcing the heart to pump harder.

In some cases, this extra effort raises blood pressure. Signs of fluid retention include swelling in the hands, feet, or ankles, which may be noticeable during therapy.

### Possible Positive Effects

[Some research](https: //www. acc. org/latest-in-cardiology/journal-scans/2023/06/20/14/42/cardiovascular-safety-of-testosterone)shows a slight increase in ** systolic pressure **(the top number in a blood pressure reading, with normal levels around 120 mmHg). [Other studies](https: //www. mayoclinicproceedings. org/article/S0025-6196%2817%2930824-8/fulltext)report no change or even improved blood vessel function.

These differences often depend on factors such as:

- Age, as older individuals may experience more pronounced effects.
- Dosage, as higher levels of testosterone can have stronger impacts.
- Pre-existing conditions like heart disease or high blood pressure, which can amplify changes.

## How to Lower Blood Pressure While on Testosterone

If testosterone therapy does cause a rise in your blood pressure, there’s no need to worry. There are many effective ways to manage and lower it.

### Lifestyle Changes

#### Dietary Adjustments

Your diet plays a big role in blood pressure. Choosing the right foods helps your heart and supports testosterone therapy.

-** Foods to Include: **-** Potassium-rich options: ** Bananas, spinach, sweet potatoes, and avocados help balance sodium levels.
  -** Healthy fats: ** Olive oil, nuts, seeds, and fatty fish improve vascular health.
  -** Fiber-rich foods: ** Whole grains like oats and quinoa keep arteries healthy.
-** Foods to Avoid: **-** Salty items: ** Processed snacks, canned soups, and fast food contain excess sodium.
  -** Sugary drinks and snacks: ** These contribute to weight gain, which can raise blood pressure and may negatively impact testosterone levels.
  -** Fried or fatty foods: ** They may negatively impact heart health over time.

Discuss dietary adjustments with your doctor or a nutritionist to align them with your therapy needs.

#### Physical Activity

Exercise strengthens your heart, improves circulation, and reduces blood pressure. Incorporate a mix of the following activities:

-** Aerobic exercises: ** Brisk walking, cycling, or swimming for 30 minutes most days.
-** Strength training: ** Moderate weightlifting to build muscle and enhance cardiovascular health.
-** Stretching or yoga: ** These activities reduce stress and promote flexibility, supporting blood vessel function.

Start at a comfortable pace and gradually increase intensity. Always check with your doctor before beginning a new exercise routine.

#### Stress Management

Stress directly affects blood pressure, causing temporary spikes that can become chronic over time. Focus on:

-** Relaxation techniques: ** Deep breathing or meditation to calm your mind.
-** Hobbies: ** Painting, gardening, or other activities that help you unwind.
-** Professional guidance: ** Speaking with a counselor or therapist if stress feels overwhelming.

Taking time to manage stress improves both physical and emotional health.

#### Hydration and Sleep

Proper hydration and quality sleep are key to blood pressure control.

- Drink ** 6–8 glasses ** of water daily to support kidney function and blood pressure regulation.
- Aim for ** 7–8 hours ** of restful sleep every night. Poor sleep can disrupt hormones and increase blood pressure.

### Medical Strategies for Managing Blood Pressure

Working with your healthcare provider is key to managing blood pressure during testosterone therapy. Regular blood tests and pressure checks help monitor your progress and detect issues early.

If needed, your doctor may adjust your testosterone dosage to reduce side effects like thicker blood or fluid retention. Never change your dosage without medical guidance, as it can cause complications.

When necessary, additional treatments like blood pressure medications or stress management techniques may be recommended. These strategies should always be tailored to your needs and supervised by your doctor.

## When to Seek Help

If you experience blood pressure issues during testosterone therapy, it’s important to seek medical advice promptly. However, these are warning signs of severe cases that require immediate attention:

- Severe headaches that don’t go away.
- Chest pain or a feeling of tightness in the chest.
- Dizziness or fainting episodes.
- Shortness of breath, especially during mild activity or at rest.

These symptoms could indicate a ** hypertensive crisis **, which is a medical emergency. Seek immediate care if you experience any of these.
