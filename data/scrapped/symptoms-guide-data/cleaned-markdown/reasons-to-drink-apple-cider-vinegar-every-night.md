## How to Safely Consume Apple Cider Vinegar

Incorporating apple cider vinegar (ACV) into your nightly routine can provide numerous health benefits, but it's essential to consume it safely to avoid any adverse effects.

Here are some tips and recipes for safe consumption:

### Practical Advice for Incorporation

-** Timing **: Drink your diluted ACV mixture about 30 minutes before bed. This timing helps maximize its benefits, such as improved digestion and blood sugar control, while minimizing potential discomfort.
-** Rinsing **: After consuming ACV, rinse your mouth with plain water to help protect your tooth enamel from acid erosion.
-** Using a Straw **: Drinking ACV through a straw can also help minimize contact with your teeth, reducing the risk of enamel erosion.

### Alternative Forms

If you find the taste of ACV too strong or unpleasant, consider taking ** ACV in pill form **. These supplements provide the benefits of ACV without the strong flavor.

Another alternative is ** ACV gummies **, which are flavored and more palatable.

However, it's important to choose gummies with no added sugar, especially if you're taking ACV for blood sugar control.

As Jessie Inchauspé [explains](https: //www. instagram. com/p/DE5TDckOJSu/? img_index=7&igsh=MW95OHNmY3pva3J6OQ%3D%3D),"Vinegar gummies contain 2 grams of sugar. That's as much sugar as in 2 candy gummy bears. They are not good for your health."

Look for gummies that only list ** vinegar ** in the ingredients and avoid any unnecessary additives.

## Potential Side Effects and Precautions

While apple cider vinegar (ACV) offers numerous health benefits, it's essential to be aware of potential side effects and take precautions to minimize risks.

-** Tooth Enamel Erosion: ** ACV is highly acidic and can erode tooth enamel if consumed undiluted or in large quantities. This can lead to increased tooth sensitivity and cavities.
-** Digestive Issues: ** Some people may experience nausea or indigestion when consuming ACV, especially if taken in large amounts or without adequate dilution.

“_ ACV is strongly acidic (5–6% acetic acid), so there are risks of enamel erosion and reflux (heartburn) too _”, states dietician and BDA spokesperson, Nichola Ludlam-Raine in her [interview](https: //www. bbc. co. uk/food/articles/apple_cider_vinegar)for BBC.

-** Interactions with Medications: ** ACV can interact with certain medications, such as diuretics and insulin, potentially leading to adverse effects.
