According to the [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chlamydia#:~:text=Key%20facts,%E2%80%9349%20years%20old)%20globally.), about **129 million** new cases of Chlamydia occur annually.\n\nThis infection can affect various parts of the body, primarily the **genitals**, but it can also infect the **throat**, **eyes**, and **rectum**. The bacteria thrive in the mucous membranes, leading to various symptoms depending on the site of infection.\n\nChlamydia spreads through sexual contact, including vaginal, anal, and oral sex. When transmitted orally, the bacteria can cause infections in the throat, sometimes leading to rare symptoms like **bumps on the tongue**. It's crucial to understand that even without symptoms, individuals can still transmit chlamydia to their partners.\n\nGeneral symptoms of chlamydia include pain during urination, unusual [discharge from the genitals](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/what%20does%20chlamydia%20discharge%20look%20like), and discomfort in the lower abdomen. In cases of oral chlamydia, symptoms may involve a sore throat, redness, and bumps on the tongue. Recognizing these symptoms early and seeking medical attention can prevent complications and the spread of the infection.\n\n## How Do You Get Oral Chlamydia?\n\nOral chlamydia occurs when the **_Chlamydia trachomatis_** bacteria infect the throat. This typically happens through **oral sex with an infected partner**. The bacteria can be transmitted during oral-penile, oral-vaginal, or oral-anal sex. While oral chlamydia is less common than genital chlamydia, it is still a significant risk for sexually active individuals.\n\nSeveral risk factors increase the likelihood of contracting oral chlamydia:\n\n- Engaging in unprotected oral sex.\n- Having multiple sexual partners.\n- Being sexually active at a young age.\n- A history of other STIs.\n\nHigh-risk behaviors, such as inconsistent use of protection like condoms or dental dams, further elevate the risk. To minimize the chances of contracting oral chlamydia and experiencing symptoms like bumps on the tongue, it is essential to practice safe sex and get regular STI screenings.\n\n## Symptoms of Oral Chlamydia\n\nOral chlamydia can be challenging to detect because its symptoms are often mild or mistaken for other conditions. **Common symptoms of oral chlamydia include**:\n\n- Persistent sore throat\n- Redness in the throat or mouth\n- Swollen tonsils or lymph nodes\n- Mild fever\n- Fatigue\n\n**Less common ones**:\n\n- Bumps on the tongue\n- Mouth sores and pain\n- White spots on the tonsils\n\nUsing tools like the [Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker) can help you identify potential symptoms of oral chlamydia, but always consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Docus AI Symptom Checker\n\nJust 3 simple steps to efficiently understand and manage your health symptoms online.\n\n[Try Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker)\n\n## What Happens if Chlamydia Goes Untreated?\n\nOral chlamydia, if left untreated, can lead to several complications that impact overall health. While the primary infection may seem mild, the potential for secondary infections and related conditions makes it crucial to address the symptoms promptly.\n\nFor males, it can result in **epididymitis**, causing pain and **swelling in the testicles** and **potential infertility**. Both genders risk developing reactive arthritis, which affects the joints.\n\nOne of the significant complications is the increased risk of **secondary oral infections**. The presence of chlamydia bacteria can compromise the immune response, making the mouth more susceptible to other infections. This can lead to conditions such as gingivitis and periodontal disease, which cause **dental pain**, **bleeding gums**, and **even tooth loss**.\n\nThe broader impact on health can be severe. **Untreated chlamydia can lead to**:\n\n- Conjunctivitis (pink eye)\n- Epididymitis (inflammation of the spermatic cord)\n- Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in females\n- Ectopic pregnancy\n- Reactive arthritis\n\nAdditionally, having oral chlamydia can increase the risk of contracting other sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. This is because chlamydia triggers an inflammatory response, drawing white blood cells (CD4 T-cells) to the site of infection, which HIV targets.\n\n## Diagnosis of Oral Chlamydia\n\nChlamydia is often asymptomatic. Approximately **70%** of women and **50%** of men with Chlamydia may not show symptoms, which is why regular screening is crucial, as per [PAHO](https://www.paho.org/en/topics/chlamydia-infection).\n\nDiagnosing oral chlamydia involves specific tests to identify the presence of _Chlamydia trachomatis_ bacteria in the throat. The most common diagnostic methods include:\n\n- **Throat Swabs:** A healthcare provider collects a sample from the throat using a cotton swab. This sample is then sent to a laboratory for analysis. [Upload the swab test results](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation/swab-test) to Docus AI doctor to get easy interpretation and personalized insights.\n- **Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs):** These tests amplify the genetic material of the bacteria, making it easier to detect even small amounts of _Chlamydia trachomatis_. NAATs are highly sensitive and can provide accurate results within a day or two.\n\nDespite these advanced diagnostic methods, there are challenges in diagnosing oral chlamydia. The symptoms often overlap with other common throat infections, leading to misdiagnosis. Additionally, routine STD screenings typically focus on genital and anal chlamydia, meaning oral infections can go undetected if specific tests are not requested.\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## Treatment for Oral Chlamydia\n\nTreating oral chlamydia involves a course of antibiotics prescribed by a healthcare professional. The treatment is similar to that for genital chlamydia and usually effective within a short period. Common antibiotics used include:\n\n- **Doxycycline**: [FDA-approved](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2022/050641Orig1s032lbl.pdf) for treating bacteria such as Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis\n- **Azithromycin**: [Approved by FDA](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2021/050670s036,050710s051,050711s050,050784s037lbl.pdf) for treating conditions caused by Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Chlamydia trachomatis bacterias.\n- **Erythromycin**: Has an antimicrobial effect on microorganisms caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, as per [FDA](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2018/050207s074,050611s036lbl.pdf).\n\n**CAUTION**: _This information is intended for educational purposes only. Use these medications only when prescribed by a doctor and under their supervision to ensure safe and effective treatment. Always consult a healthcare professional before starting any new medication._\n\nPost-treatment precautions are essential to ensure the infection is fully cleared and to prevent reinfection. Patients are advised to **avoid sexual contact**, including oral, vaginal, and anal sex, for at least seven days after completing the antibiotic course. Even if symptoms disappear quickly, it's important to **complete the entire prescribed course of antibiotics** to ensure the infection is fully eradicated.\n\nIt's also crucial to treat all sexual partners to prevent the spread of the infection.\n\n## Prevention\n\n- **Consistent Use of Protection:** Always use condoms or dental dams during oral, vaginal, and anal sex to reduce the transmission of STIs.\n- **Regular Testing:** Get tested regularly for STIs, especially if you have multiple sexual partners or engage in unprotected sex.\n- **Limit Number of Sexual Partners:** Reducing the number of sexual partners can decrease the risk of exposure to STIs.\n- **Mutual Monogamy:** Being in a mutually monogamous relationship where both partners are tested and free of STIs can significantly reduce the risk.\n- **Avoid Sharing Personal Items:** Do not share items like towels or toothbrushes that might be contaminated.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What are chlamydia bumps on the tongue?\n\nChlamydia bumps on the tongue are rare but can occur when the Chlamydia trachomatis bacteria infect the oral cavity. These bumps can be accompanied by other symptoms such as a sore throat, redness, and mouth sores. If you notice unusual bumps on your tongue, it's important to seek medical advice promptly for proper diagnosis and treatment.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Can HPV cause bumps on the tongue like chlamydia?\n\nYes, [HPV (human papillomavirus) can also cause bumps on the tongue](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/hpv-bumps-on-back-of-tongue). While chlamydia is a bacterial infection, HPV is a viral infection, and both can manifest with similar oral symptoms, including bumps. It's crucial to get tested to determine the exact cause of the symptoms since treatment approaches differ for bacterial and viral infections.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Are bumps on the tongue always a sign of an STD like chlamydia?\n\nBumps on the tongue are not always indicative of an STD like chlamydia. They can be caused by various conditions, including other infections, allergic reactions, or even trauma to the tongue. However, if you have engaged in unprotected oral sex and notice bumps on your tongue, it's advisable to consult a healthcare provider to rule out chlamydia or other STDs.\n\nHave more questions?
