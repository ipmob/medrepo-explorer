Understanding these causes can help you prevent future occurrences:\n\n- **Trauma**: Any kind of injury or impact to the eye, even a minor one, can cause blood vessels to break. [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551666/) from StatPearls indicates that traumatic subconjunctival hemorrhage is more common among young males, likely due to their involvement in heavy labor and more vigorous activities.\n- **High Blood Pressure**: Elevated blood pressure can weaken the blood vessels, making them more prone to breaking.\n- **Contact Lenses**: Improper use or fitting of contact lenses can irritate the eye and potentially cause blood vessels to break.\n- **Sneezing or Coughing**: Sudden and forceful sneezing or coughing can increase pressure in the blood vessels, leading to a break.\n- **Straining**: Physical strain from heavy lifting, constipation, or even vigorous exercise can cause blood vessels to rupture.\n- **Rubbing the Eye**: Aggressive rubbing of the eye can lead to broken blood vessels.\n- **Vomiting**: Intense vomiting episodes can cause blood vessels to break due to the sudden increase in pressure.\n- **Medications**: Certain medications that affect blood clotting can increase the likelihood of a subconjunctival hemorrhage. These include anticoagulants, antiplatelets, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\n\n### Symptoms\n\nA broken blood vessel in the eye is usually easy to spot. The most common symptom is a bright red or dark spot on the sclera. Here are some typical symptoms:\n\n- **Red Spot**: A vivid red or dark spot on the white part of the eye, which can be small or cover a large area.\n- **Irritation**: You might feel a mild scratchy sensation in the affected eye.\n- **Absence of Pain**: Typically, there is no pain associated with a subconjunctival hemorrhage.\n- **No Vision Changes**: Your vision should remain unaffected by the hemorrhage.\n\nDespite its alarming appearance, a broken blood vessel in the eye usually doesn't cause pain or affect vision. However, if you experience any pain or vision changes, it's important to seek medical advice immediately.\n\nIf you are unsure about your symptoms and want to check them, use the [Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker).

Always consult a professional before taking any action.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Docus AI Symptom Checker\n\nJust 3 simple steps to efficiently understand and manage your health symptoms online.\n\n[Try Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker)\n\n### Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosing a subconjunctival hemorrhage is straightforward. Your doctor or eye specialist will generally diagnose it by simply looking at your eye. Here’s how the process usually goes:\n\n- **Visual Inspection**: The doctor will examine the affected eye to identify the presence of the red spot.\n- **Medical History**: They might ask about your overall health, any recent activities, and any medications you are taking.\n- **Blood Pressure Check**: Checking your blood pressure helps identify if high blood pressure could be a contributing factor.\n- **Additional Tests**: If you have recurrent episodes, the doctor might conduct additional tests to rule out any underlying bleeding disorders. These could include a routine [blood test](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview) to check for clotting issues.\n\n## Can You Speed Up Healing?\n\nAlthough you can't make the healing process faster, understanding how a subconjunctival hemorrhage heals and how to manage the symptoms can help you feel more comfortable while your eye recovers.\n\n### Natural Healing Process\n\nAccording to the American Academy of Ophthalmology ( [AAO](https://www.aao.org/eye-health/diseases/what-is-subconjunctival-hemorrhage)), this condition should resolve without any treatment. The healing process can take a **few days to a few weeks**, depending on the size of the affected area. The conjunctiva slowly absorbs the trapped blood, causing the red spot to gradually fade away naturally.\n\nHowever, approximately **10%** of individuals with no known risk factors experience a recurrence of the subconjunctival hemorrhage, according to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17713-subconjunctival-hemorrhage).\n\n### What You Can Do\n\nWhile you can't significantly speed up the natural healing process, there are practical steps you can take to manage symptoms and ensure a more comfortable recovery:\n\n- **Use of Lubricating Eye Drops**: Applying lubricating eye drops, also known as artificial tears, can help alleviate any scratchy or uncomfortable sensation in the affected eye. These drops keep the eye moist and soothe irritation.\n- **Apply Cold Compresses**: Applying a cold compress several times a day can be a simple yet effective way to alleviate discomfort associated with a broken blood vessel in the eye. The cold temperature helps reduce any swelling and provides soothing relief.\n- **Avoid \"Redness Relieving\" Drops**: It's best to steer clear of eye drops labeled as \"redness relieving\" or \"whitening.\" These products can cause blood vessels to constrict temporarily, potentially leading to a rebound effect where redness returns more intensely once the drops wear off.\n\n## Preventing Broken Blood Vessels in the Eye\n\nPreventing broken blood vessels in the eye is largely about protecting your eyes from injury and managing overall health. Here are some tips to help you avoid future occurrences:\n\n- **Wearing Protective Eyewear**: During activities that pose a risk to your eyes, such as playing sports, working with tools, or being in environments with flying debris, always wear appropriate protective eyewear. This can significantly reduce the risk of trauma to the eyes.\n- **Managing Underlying Health Conditions**: Conditions like high blood pressure can contribute to the breaking of blood vessels in the eye. Regular check-ups and managing these conditions through lifestyle changes and medication can help prevent subconjunctival hemorrhages.\n- **Avoiding Rubbing the Eyes**: Rubbing your eyes can cause small blood vessels to break, leading to a subconjunctival hemorrhage. If your eyes are itchy or irritated, use lubricating eye drops instead of rubbing them.\n\n## When to See a Doctor\n\nWhile a broken blood vessel in the eye is usually harmless and resolves on its own, there are certain situations where consulting an eye doctor is crucial. Here are some guidelines on when it's essential to seek medical attention:\n\n- **After Eye Trauma**: If the broken blood vessel occurred after any kind of trauma to the eye, it is necessary to see a doctor. Eye injuries can sometimes cause more serious damage that isn't immediately apparent.\n- **Persistent Redness**: If the redness doesn't start to improve after a week or continues to spread, a medical consultation is recommended.\n- [**Pain**](https://docus.ai/tags/eye-pain) **or** [**Vision Problems**](https://docus.ai/tags/vision-problems): Experiencing pain, significant discomfort, or any changes in vision requires immediate medical attention. These symptoms could indicate a more serious underlying issue.\n- **Recurrent Hemorrhages**: If broken blood vessels in the eye happen frequently, it is important to see a doctor to rule out underlying health conditions that might be causing the recurrent hemorrhages.\n- **Bleeding Disorders**: Individuals with known bleeding disorders or those taking blood-thinning medications should consult their doctor if they notice a broken blood vessel in the eye, as it might be related to their condition or medication.\n\nIn these cases, an eye doctor will conduct a thorough examination to determine the cause of the hemorrhage and ensure that there is no more serious underlying condition. Always prioritize professional medical advice to ensure eye health and overall well-being.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What Causes a Broken Blood Vessel in the Eye?\n\nA broken blood vessel in the eye, or subconjunctival hemorrhage, can be caused by several factors such as trauma, high blood pressure, sneezing, coughing, straining, rubbing the eye, vomiting, improper use of contact lenses, and certain medications that affect blood clotting.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# How Long Does It Take for a Broken Blood Vessel in the Eye to Heal?\n\nThe healing process usually takes between one to three weeks, depending on the size of the hemorrhage.
