These harmless bumps, made of keratin, typically resolve on their own within a few weeks to months. They do not cause discomfort or health issues and require no treatment.\n\n![epstein pearls](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2F7400ed2742296b58924dbd9d9b31fe0b.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\nContents\n\n- [What Are Epstein Pearls?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/epstein-pearls#what-are-epstein-pearls)\n- [Symptoms](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/epstein-pearls#symptoms)\n- [Causes of Epstein Pearls](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/epstein-pearls#causes-of-epstein-pearls)\n- [Diagnosing Epstein Pearls](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/epstein-pearls#diagnosing-epstein-pearls)\n- [Treatment and Management](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/epstein-pearls#treatment-and-management)\n- [When to Consult a Medical Professional](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/epstein-pearls#when-to-consult-a-medical-professional)\n- [Conclusion](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/epstein-pearls#conclusion)\n\n## What Are Epstein Pearls?\n\nEpstein pearls are tiny, **benign cysts** that appear in the mouths of newborn babies. These **white** or **yellowish** bumps are commonly found along the gums or on the roof of the mouth. Made of **keratin**, a protein present in hair, skin, and nails, Epstein pearls are harmless and typically resolve on their own without any need for medical treatment.\n\nAccording to the [Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/article/NBK/NBK493177) journal, Epstein pearls are very common, appearing in approximately **60% to 85%** of all newborns. Their frequent occurrence makes them a normal part of many infants' early lives. Importantly, Epstein pearls are not a sign of any health issue and usually disappear within a few weeks to months.\n\n![epstein pearls appearance](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2Ffeb33d472eaf86dd664b29986074591c.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Symptoms\n\nEpstein pearls are small, firm **nodules** that are white or yellowish in color. They are typically **less than a few millimeters** in diameter. These cysts can appear alone or in clusters of several nodules. While their appearance may concern parents, it’s important to know that Epstein pearls do not cause any pain or discomfort to the baby.\n\n### Resemblance to Emerging Teeth\n\nOne of the main reasons Epstein pearls can cause concern is their resemblance to emerging baby teeth. They appear as small, firm bumps along the gums, which can be easily mistaken for teeth breaking through.\n\nHowever, unlike teeth, Epstein pearls are temporary and will go away on their own. If you’re ever unsure whether you're seeing Epstein pearls or early teeth, consulting with a pediatrician can provide clarity and peace of mind.\n\n![epstein pearls resemblance](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2F38b77b0fdbef4c1879f120e27c9ba2ae.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Causes of Epstein Pearls\n\nEpstein pearls form due to a natural biological process that occurs during fetal development. These cysts are composed of keratin, the same protein that makes up our hair, skin, and nails. Let's explore the detailed process behind their formation.\n\nDuring fetal development, the mouth and palate undergo significant changes. As the fetus grows, the oral tissues start to fuse together. This fusion is crucial for the proper formation of the mouth. However, sometimes small amounts of tissue get trapped during this process. These trapped tissues eventually form into tiny cysts filled with keratin, known as Epstein pearls.\n\n**How Oral Tissues Become Trapped During Fetal Development:**\n\n- **Development of the Palate**: The roof of the mouth, or the palate, forms from two separate structures that gradually fuse together in the middle. If small pieces of tissue become trapped during this fusion, they can develop into Epstein pearls.\n- **Keratin Buildup**: The trapped tissues produce keratin, which fills the cysts and gives them their characteristic white or yellowish appearance.\n\n## Diagnosing Epstein Pearls\n\nDiagnosing Epstein pearls is straightforward for healthcare providers. These cysts have distinctive characteristics that make them easy to identify during a routine examination. However, it's essential to differentiate them from other conditions that might look similar.\n\n### How Healthcare Providers Diagnose the Condition\n\nHealthcare providers typically diagnose Epstein pearls through a simple **visual examination** of the baby's mouth. The distinctive appearance of these cysts—small, white or yellowish, and firm to the touch—allows for easy identification.\n\n### Differentiating from Other Conditions\n\nWhile Epstein pearls are benign and harmless, other oral conditions in newborns might require different approaches. Here are some conditions that healthcare providers consider:\n\n- [**Thrush**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/normal-baby-tongue-vs-thrush): This is a common fungal infection that can cause white patches in the mouth. Unlike Epstein pearls, thrush may cause discomfort and needs treatment with antifungal medication.\n- **Natal Teeth**: Some babies are born with one or more teeth, which can be mistaken for Epstein pearls. Natal teeth are actual teeth and can cause discomfort or feeding issues, sometimes requiring removal.\n- **Other [Oral Cysts](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/gum-cyst)**: Other types of benign [oral cysts](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/eruption-cyst) can appear similar to Epstein pearls but may be located differently or have different characteristics.\n\n### Symptoms Requiring Differential Diagnosis\n\n- Persistent white patches that do not match the typical appearance of Epstein pearls.\n- Symptoms such as discomfort, feeding difficulties, or visible signs of infection.\n- Any growths that change in size or appearance over time.\n\nUsing these criteria, healthcare providers can confidently diagnose Epstein pearls and provide reassurance to parents.

There is no need for parents to monitor them closely, as this process is entirely natural.\n\n### Prevention\n\nEpstein pearls are a **natural occurrence** and cannot be prevented. They form as a result of normal developmental processes during fetal growth. Since they are not caused by any external factors, there is no way to prevent their formation.\n\n## When to Consult a Medical Professional\n\n- **Persistent Cysts**: If the cysts do not resolve within three months.\n- **Growth or Change in Appearance**: If the cysts grow larger or change in appearance over time.\n- **Discomfort or Feeding Issues**: If the baby shows signs of discomfort, pain, or has difficulty feeding.\n- **Additional Symptoms**: Any other unusual symptoms, such as redness, swelling, or signs of infection.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What are Epstein pearls?\n\nEpstein pearls are small, benign cysts filled with keratin that appear in the mouths of newborns.
