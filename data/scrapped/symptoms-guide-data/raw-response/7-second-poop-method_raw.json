Naturally, you’re curious…\n\nSo, what exactly is this trick, and how does it work? **Let’s dive in!**\n\n![7 second poop method](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2Fa85c7e76c378a3fbfb6b5f9ae67ed2df.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\nContents\n\n- [What Is the 7-Second Poop Method?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/7-second-poop-method#what-is-the-7-second-poop-method)\n- [Limitations and Who Should Avoid It](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/7-second-poop-method#limitations-and-who-should-avoid-it)\n- [Why Is Apple Cider Vinegar Linked to the 7-Second Poop Method?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/7-second-poop-method#why-is-apple-cider-vinegar-linked-to-the-7-second-poop-method)\n- [Wait… This Isn’t the Only 7-Second Poop Method?!](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/7-second-poop-method#wait-this-isnt-the-only-7-second-poop-method)\n- [Final Thoughts](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/7-second-poop-method#final-thoughts)\n\n## What Is the 7-Second Poop Method?\n\nThe 7-second poop method is a quick morning routine that helps with smooth and easy bowel movements.\n\nIt was introduced by [Dr. Gina Sam](https://drginasam.net/), a gastroenterologist, as a natural way to support gut health without relying on medications or drastic diet changes.\n\nSoon the trick went viral on **social media**, sparking discussions among health enthusiasts and medical professionals alike.\n\nBut let’s be clear—this method **doesn’t mean you’ll be done pooping in 7 seconds**. Instead, it’s a set of **quick steps** that prepare your digestive system for an easier bathroom experience.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\n### Start with Warm Water\n\nDrinking a glass of **warm water first thing in the morning** is one of the easiest ways to wake up your digestive system.\n\nWarm water **hydrates the intestines**, softens stool, and kickstarts bowel movements naturally.\n\nAim for **a full glass** (around 8 ounces) before coffee or breakfast for the best results.\n\n### Gentle Stretching and Yoga\n\nMovement is a powerful way to **stimulate digestion**. Certain **yoga poses** can encourage your intestines to move waste along by engaging your core and applying gentle pressure to your abdomen.\n\nHere are some of the best **poses for digestion**:\n\n- **Knees-to-Chest Pose**: Lie on your back and hug your knees into your chest. Hold for a few breaths to **massage your intestines** and **stimulate movement**.\n- **Cat-Cow Stretch**: Get on all fours and alternate between arching your back ( **Cow**) and rounding it ( **Cat**). This **increases circulation to your gut**, helping move things along.\n- **Downward-Facing Dog**: From a tabletop position, lift your hips to form an upside-down “V.” This pose **increases blood flow** to your digestive organs and **relieves bloating**.\n- **Deep Squats**: Squatting is one of the most natural positions for bowel movements. Holding a deep squat for **30 seconds to 1 minute** helps **relax your pelvic floor muscles** and improves bowel movement efficiency.\n\nJust stretch before heading to the bathroom.\n\n![yoga poses for digestion](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2F6179a15bfd907d1fdc1c22c1e96fe977.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n**Title**: Stretching and yoga poses for improved digestion.\n\n**Sources**: [Hingehealth](https://www.hingehealth.com/resources/articles/benefits-of-deep-squat/), [Gympik](https://www.gympik.com/articles/6-easy-exercises-for-lower-back-pain/cat-cow-pose-3/).\n\n## Limitations and Who Should Avoid It\n\nThe 7-second poop method supports digestion by relieving constipation, promoting hydration, and improving gut health through warm water, movement, and deep breathing.\n\nWhile this method works for many, it’s **not a one-size-fits-all solution**. Here are some things to keep in mind:\n\n- **Not a cure-all** – It can help with **mild constipation**, but **chronic digestive issues** may need other solutions.\n- **May not be effective for everyone** – Factors like **diet, hydration, stress, and gut bacteria** all play a role in digestion.\n- **People with medical conditions should consult a doctor** – If you have **IBS, chronic constipation, or other digestive disorders**, talk to a healthcare provider before trying new methods.\n\n**Note**: _This method can be a safe and easy way to support digestion. But if you experience_ **_persistent issues_** _, it’s best to_ **_seek professional advice_** _._\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Your Personal AI Doctor\n\nCustomize your AI Doctor to ask any health-related questions.

Now you’re probably wondering **what** **ACV has to do with this?**\n\nWhile ACV isn’t part of the **original method**, some people **swear by it** as a **digestion booster** when paired with warm water in the morning.\n\n- [**ACV may aid digestion**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/reasons-to-drink-apple-cider-vinegar-every-night) – It contains **acetic acid**, which can help **stimulate stomach acid production**, making it easier to break down food.\n- **It could promote bowel movements** – Some believe that ACV acts as a **mild laxative**, encouraging regularity.\n- **Supports gut bacteria** – Raw, unfiltered ACV contains **natural probiotics (\"the mother\")**, which may benefit digestion.\n\nThat said, **ACV isn’t necessary** for the 7-second poop method to work. Some find it helpful, while others **experience discomfort, especially if they have acid reflux or a sensitive stomach**.\n\nIf you’re curious, try adding a **small amount to your morning routine** and see how your body reacts.\n\nIf you have digestive issues or concerns, consult a doctor before making it a habit.\n\n## Wait… This Isn’t the Only 7-Second Poop Method?!\n\nIf you’ve been looking up the 7-second poop method, you’ve probably noticed something confusing— **not everyone describes it the same way.**\n\nMany sources say it’s about drinking warm water, stretching, and deep breathing.\n\nSome claim that **applying firm pressure on the lower abdomen** or using circular self-massage techniques can help release trapped gas and ease constipation.\n\nOthers suggest that **increasing fiber intake**, drinking ACV, or eating certain gut-friendly foods is the key to a faster and smoother bathroom experience.\n\nOh, and one more— **the “fist-rubbing trick.”** This lesser-known method suggests that rubbing your fists together, thumb to thumb, for a couple of minutes can stimulate digestion and trigger a bowel movement.\n\nDoes it actually work? There’s no scientific backing, but hey, some people swear by it.\n\nThe truth is, **there isn’t one official definition** of the 7-second poop method. It’s a **term that has spread online**, with different people adding their own interpretations.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nThe 7-second poop method offers a simple way to support digestion and ease constipation through warm water, gentle movement, and deep breathing.\n\nWhile it’s not a guaranteed fix for everyone, many find it helpful for maintaining regularity. If digestive issues persist, it’s best to seek medical advice to rule out underlying conditions.\n\n#### Sources\n\nThis article was reviewed by leading experts in gastroenterology.
