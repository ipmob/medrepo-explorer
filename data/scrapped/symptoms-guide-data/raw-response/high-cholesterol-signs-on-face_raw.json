Recognizing these symptoms is crucial for early detection and management of this condition, which can be caused by factors such as diet, lack of exercise, and genetics.\n\n![signs of high cholesterol on face](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2F5147d042d6879db664c6156d3edec57f.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\nContents\n\n- [What is High Cholesterol?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/high-cholesterol-signs-on-face#what-is-high-cholesterol)\n- [Facial Signs of High Cholesterol](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/high-cholesterol-signs-on-face#facial-signs-of-high-cholesterol)\n- [Testing and Diagnosis](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/high-cholesterol-signs-on-face#testing-and-diagnosis)\n- [Treatment and Management](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/high-cholesterol-signs-on-face#treatment-and-management)\n- [Conclusion](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/high-cholesterol-signs-on-face#conclusion)\n\n## What is High Cholesterol?\n\n[Cholesterol](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/cholesterol) is a fatty substance produced by the liver and found in certain foods. It is essential for building cells and producing hormones and vitamins.\n\nHigh cholesterol, also known as **hypercholesterolemia**, is a condition where there is an excessive amount of cholesterol in the blood. Too much cholesterol can be harmful, leading to health issues such as cardiovascular diseases.\n\nCholesterol travels through the bloodstream attached to proteins. This combination of proteins and cholesterol is called lipoproteins. There are two main [types of lipoproteins](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/cholesterol#types-of-cholesterol):\n\n- **Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL):** Often referred to as \"bad\" cholesterol, LDL carries cholesterol particles throughout your body. High levels of LDL cholesterol can lead to the buildup of fatty deposits in your arteries, which can restrict blood flow and increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.\n- **High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL):** Known as \"good\" cholesterol, HDL helps remove cholesterol from your bloodstream, transporting it to the liver, where it is broken down and eliminated from the body. Higher levels of HDL cholesterol are beneficial and help reduce the risk of heart disease.\n\nAccording to [data](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23921-hypercholesterolemia) from the Cleveland Clinic, approximately **5%** of people have hypercholesterolemia. Almost **1/3** of American adults have elevated levels of LDL cholesterol.\n\n### Causes and Risk Factors of High Cholesterol\n\nSeveral factors contribute to high cholesterol, some of which are within your control, while others are not. Understanding these causes and risk factors can help you take steps to manage your cholesterol levels effectively.\n\n1. **Unhealthy Diet:** Consuming foods high in saturated and trans fats can lead to unhealthy cholesterol levels. Focus on a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.\n2. **Lack of Exercise:** Incorporating regular physical activity into your routine can help manage cholesterol levels. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week.\n3. **Obesity:** A Body Mass Index (BMI) of more than 30 increases the risk of high cholesterol. Weight management through diet and exercise is crucial.\n4. **Smoking:** Smoking can lower HDL (good) cholesterol and damage the walls of your blood vessels, making them more susceptible to plaque buildup.\n5. **Age:** As you age, your liver becomes less efficient at removing LDL cholesterol from your bloodstream. This natural aging process can contribute to higher cholesterol levels.\n6. **Family History:** Genetics plays a significant role in cholesterol levels. If you have a family history of high cholesterol, you are at a higher risk of developing the condition.\n7. **Other Medical Conditions:** Conditions such as [diabetes](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/diabetes), chronic [kidney disease](https://docus.ai/tags/kidney-diseases), and hypothyroidism can increase the risk of high cholesterol. Managing these conditions with the help of a healthcare professional is essential.\n\n## Facial Signs of High Cholesterol\n\nRecognizing the signs of high cholesterol on the face can be crucial for early detection and management. Here are some key facial indicators:\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Docus AI Symptom Checker\n\nJust 3 simple steps to efficiently understand and manage your health symptoms online.\n\n[Try Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker)\n\n### Xanthelasma\n\n[Xanthelasma](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/high-cholesterol-symptoms-eyes#eye-symptoms-of-high-cholesterol) are **yellowish**, **fatty deposits that appear around the eyelids**. These deposits form when cholesterol builds up under the skin, creating small, yellowish bumps that are usually soft to the touch. While xanthelasma are typically harmless and do not cause pain, their presence can indicate elevated cholesterol levels.\n\nThis condition is often linked to **high LDL** (bad) cholesterol and **low HDL** (good) cholesterol levels. People with these fatty deposits should consider getting their cholesterol levels checked, as these bumps are a visible sign of potential hypercholesterolemia.\n\nHowever, the Cleveland Clinic [states](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23385-xanthelasma) that half of the people with xanthelasmas do not have high cholesterol.\n\n![Xanthelasma](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2F72dd62c8a765040103f4b7a4f9df359c.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n### Arcus Senilis (Corneal Arcus)\n\n[Arcus senilis](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/high-cholesterol-symptoms-eyes#eye-symptoms-of-high-cholesterol) is characterized by a **grayish-white ring or arc that appears around the cornea of the eye**. This ring forms due to cholesterol deposits in the cornea. Although arcus senilis is common in older adults and is generally considered a normal part of aging, its presence in younger individuals can be a red flag for high cholesterol levels.\n\nHowever, when observed in people **under 40**, it often indicates high cholesterol and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nTherefore, if you notice this ring around your eye and you are relatively young, it's important to get your cholesterol levels checked.\n\n![Arcus senilis](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2F22ae6deb9a632a4d2a79aea33ab5c6ed.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n### Psoriasis\n\nPsoriasis is a chronic [autoimmune condition](https://docus.ai/tags/autoimmune-diseases) that causes **red**, **scaly patches on the skin**.\n\nThe inflammatory nature of psoriasis and high cholesterol share common pathways, contributing to their correlation. A recent [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38031463/#:~:text=Conclusion%3A%20Bidirectional%20two%2Dsample%20MR,genetic%20risk%20factors%20for%20psoriasis.) from the Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology indicates that high levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol are genetic risk factors for psoriasis.\n\nRisk factors like obesity, lack of exercise, and a diet high in unhealthy fats can exacerbate both conditions. Managing cholesterol levels through lifestyle changes and medical treatment can help reduce the severity of psoriasis and improve overall health.\n\n![Psoriasis](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2Fd31826767ab1a0b015d4d6a20dac3a2c.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n### Lichen Planus\n\nLichen planus is an inflammatory condition that presents as **shiny**, **purple or red bumps on the skin or inside the mouth**. These bumps may itch and can appear anywhere on the body, including the face.\n\nSome [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4753036/#:~:text=The%20results%20of%20the%20present,by%20Dreiher%20et%20al%2C11) have found a link between lichen planus and high cholesterol, although the exact mechanism is not fully understood.\n\nThis correlation suggests that managing cholesterol levels might help alleviate some symptoms of lichen planus. Regular checkups and lipid panels are recommended for individuals with this condition to monitor and manage their cholesterol levels effectively.\n\n![Lichen Planus](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2Fb4de9116a4cda1238eb6240705576485.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n### Eruptive Xanthomas\n\nEruptive xanthomas are **small**, **red** or **yellowish bumps** that appear suddenly on the skin. They are often found on the **elbows**, **knees**, **buttocks**, and **back** but can also appear on the face, particularly **around the eyes**. These bumps are caused by extremely high levels of **triglycerides**, a type of fat found in the blood.\n\nEruptive xanthomas are a clear sign of dangerously high triglyceride levels, which can increase the risk of **acute pancreatitis**. Immediate medical attention and lifestyle changes are necessary to manage triglyceride levels and prevent further health complications.\n\n![Eruptive Xanthomas](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2F3cb32665a87401b429a539bd85c42c88.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\nRecognizing these facial signs can help you identify potential high cholesterol and take action. Regular cholesterol checks and consultations with healthcare professionals are essential. For a personalized assessment of your symptoms and risks, use the Docus AI [Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker) tool, and always seek professional medical advice for accurate diagnosis and treatment.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Docus AI Symptom Checker\n\nJust 3 simple steps to efficiently understand and manage your health symptoms online.\n\n[Try Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker)\n\n## Testing and Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosing high cholesterol is crucial for preventing serious health complications such as heart disease and stroke. [Blood tests](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview) are the primary method for diagnosing high cholesterol and assessing cardiovascular risk.\n\n### Lipid Panel Tests\n\nA lipid panel test is the most common type of blood test used to [measure cholesterol levels](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/cholesterol#how-to-measure-cholesterol). This test provides a comprehensive overview of the different types of cholesterol and lipids in the blood. The lipid panel includes measurements of:\n\n- **Total Cholesterol:** The overall amount of cholesterol in the blood.\n- **Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) Cholesterol:** Often referred to as \"bad\" cholesterol, high levels can lead to the buildup of plaque in arteries.\n- **High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) Cholesterol:** Known as \"good\" cholesterol, it helps remove LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream.\n- **Triglycerides:** A type of fat found in the blood; high levels can increase the risk of heart disease.\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n### Frequency of Testing\n\nThe frequency of cholesterol testing depends on age, risk factors, and overall health. The NHLBI [recommends](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/blood-cholesterol/diagnosis) the following general guidelines:\n\n- **Ages 19 or younger**: Screening begins at ages 9 to 11 and should be repeated every 5 years. Screening may be performed as early as age 2 if there is a family history of high blood cholesterol, heart attack, or stroke.\n- **Ages 20 to 65**: Younger adults should be screened every 5 years. Men ages 45 to 65 and women ages 55 to 65 should be screened every 1 to 2 years.\n- **Older than 65**: Older adults should be screened every year.\n\n**Note:** _Those with existing cardiovascular conditions, diabetes, or a family history of high cholesterol may need to undergo cholesterol tests more frequently, as advised by their healthcare provider._\n\n## Treatment and Management\n\nManaging high cholesterol is essential to reduce the risk of serious health complications such as heart disease and stroke. Treatment usually involves a combination of medications and lifestyle modifications.\n\n### Medications\n\nSeveral types of medications can help lower cholesterol levels:\n\n- **Statins:** Reduce cholesterol production in the liver and help remove cholesterol from the blood.\n- **Bile Acid Sequestrants:** Bind to bile acids in the intestines, leading the liver to use more cholesterol to produce bile acids, thus reducing cholesterol levels.\n- **Niacin:** Increases HDL (good) cholesterol and lowers LDL cholesterol and triglycerides.\n- **Fibrates:** Primarily reduce triglyceride levels and can increase HDL cholesterol.\n- **Injectable Medications:** Help lower LDL cholesterol by enhancing the liver's ability to remove it from the blood.\n\n### Lifestyle Modifications\n\nLifestyle changes are crucial for managing high cholesterol effectively:\n\n- **Healthy Diet:** Eat a diet rich in fiber (fruits, vegetables, whole grains) and healthy fats (olive oil, nuts). The American Heart Association [advises](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cholesterol/prevention-and-treatment-of-high-cholesterol-hyperlipidemia) keeping saturated fat intake below 6% of your daily calories and avoiding trans fats altogether.\n- **Regular Exercise:** The American Heart Association [states](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cholesterol/prevention-and-treatment-of-high-cholesterol-hyperlipidemia) that at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week is sufficient to reduce both cholesterol and high blood pressure.\n- **Maintaining a Healthy Weight:** Achieve and maintain a healthy weight through diet and exercise to help lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides while increasing HDL cholesterol.\n- **Limiting Alcohol Consumption:** Drink alcohol in moderation—up to one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men.\n- **Quitting Smoking:** Improves HDL cholesterol levels and overall heart health.\n\n### Stress Management\n\nChronic stress can negatively impact cholesterol levels. Techniques such as meditation, yoga, and deep breathing can help manage stress effectively.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What are the skin symptoms of high cholesterol?\n\nHigh cholesterol can manifest on the skin as xanthelasma, which is yellowish, fatty deposits around the eyelids, and eruptive xanthomas, which are small, red, or yellowish bumps. Other symptoms include lichen planus, which presents as shiny, purple, or red bumps, and psoriasis, which causes red, scaly patches on the skin.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# How can I naturally remove cholesterol deposits around my eyes?\n\nNatural methods to reduce cholesterol deposits, or xanthelasma, around the eyes include maintaining a healthy diet, regular exercise, and managing cholesterol levels. However, these deposits often require medical treatment for removal.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What are the symptoms of high cholesterol in the eyes?\n\nHigh cholesterol can cause symptoms in the eyes such as arcus senilis, a grayish-white ring around the cornea, and xanthelasma, yellowish deposits on the eyelids.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What is xanthelasma?\n\nXanthelasma are yellowish, fatty deposits around the eyelids caused by the buildup of cholesterol under the skin. They can indicate elevated cholesterol levels.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What are eruptive xanthomas?\n\nEruptive xanthomas are small, red or yellowish bumps that appear suddenly on the skin due to extremely high levels of triglycerides in the blood.
