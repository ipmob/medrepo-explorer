This condition is called pink eye when caused by bacterial or viral infections.\n\nAccording to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/conjunctivitis/about/index.html), conjunctivitis is one of the most common and treatable eye conditions.\n\nConjunctivitis can be caused by viruses, bacteria, or allergens:\n\n- **[Viral](https://docus.ai/tags/viral-infections) Conjunctivitis**: Often associated with colds, it spreads easily and typically resolves on its own.\n- **Bacterial Conjunctivitis**: Caused by bacteria, it produces a thick discharge and may require antibiotics.\n- **Allergic Conjunctivitis (eye allergies)**: [Triggered by allergens](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/allergy-headache-relief#common-allergy-triggers) like pollen or dust, it is not contagious and usually affects both eyes.\n\n## Identifying Symptoms\n\n[Differentiating between infectious pink eye](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/conditions-misdiagnosed-as-pink-eye) and allergic conjunctivitis is crucial for effective treatment. Both conditions can cause eye redness and discomfort, but they have distinct characteristics.\n\n### Infectious Pink Eye Symptoms\n\n- **Redness**: The white part of the eye and the inner eyelid become visibly red.\n- **Itchiness**: There is often an uncomfortable itchy sensation that makes you want to rub your eyes.\n- [**Discharge**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/sinus-infection-and-eye-discharge): Eyes may produce a sticky, yellow, or greenish discharge that can cause the eyelids to stick together, especially after sleeping.\n- **Eyelid Crusting**: The discharge may dry on the eyelids and lashes, leading to crust formation, particularly noticeable after waking up.\n- **Tearing**: There may be an increase in tears, causing the eyes to be watery.\n- **Swelling**: The eyelids might swell, adding to the discomfort and irritation.\n- [**Blurred Vision**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/solving-blurry-vision-in-one-eye-causes-and-solutions): The discharge and tearing can temporarily blur vision until the eye is cleared.\n- **Sensitivity to Light**: Eyes might become more sensitive to light, which can be painful or uncomfortable.\n\n![Infectious Pink Eye](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2F33822d372452183613cef9d7a7a37fda.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n### Eye Allergies Symptoms\n\n- **Redness**: The eyes may appear noticeably redder than usual, which is a reaction to allergens.\n- **Itchiness**: This is often the most common and noticeable symptom, where the individual feels a need to rub their eyes frequently.\n- **Watering**: Allergic reactions often lead to excessive tearing as the eyes try to flush out irritants.\n- **Swelling**: The eyelids may become swollen and puffy in response to allergen exposure.\n- **Burning Sensation**: Some people might feel a burning sensation in their eyes, which can be uncomfortable.\n- **Sensitivity to Light**: During an allergic reaction, the eyes might become more sensitive to light, causing discomfort in bright environments.\n\n![Eye Allergies](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2F307abe4ef3af231187002304176bc5e5.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\nBy understanding these symptoms, you can better identify whether you're dealing with pink eye or allergies, and take appropriate action.\n\nFor further guidance, consider using an online toolÂ [AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker) to help identify your symptoms and decide when to seek professional medical advice. Always consult a healthcare provider for a precise diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Docus AI Symptom Checker\n\nJust 3 simple steps to efficiently understand and manage your health symptoms online.\n\n[Try Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker)\n\n## Early Symptoms and Diagnosis\n\nEarly symptoms of conjunctivitis, whether caused by infection or allergies, can often overlap, making it difficult to distinguish between them at first. Common initial signs include **redness**, **irritation**, and **increased tearing**.\n\nBoth **bacterial** and **viral** pink eye typically **start in one eye** and can spread to the other, while **allergic** conjunctivitis usually **affects both eyes simultaneously**.\n\n### Diagnostic Methods\n\nHealthcare professionals use several methods to diagnose the type of conjunctivitis:\n\n- **Medical History and Symptom Review**: Evaluating recent illnesses, exposure to allergens, and symptom onset.\n- **Physical Examination**: Inspecting the eyes for signs of infection or allergic reaction.\n- **Discharge Sampling**: In persistent or severe cases, a sample of eye discharge may be taken to identify the specific cause through laboratory analysis.\n- **Allergy Testing**: If allergic conjunctivitis is suspected, an allergy test may be conducted to identify specific allergens causing the reaction. This can help in formulating a targeted treatment plan.\n\n## Treatment Options\n\nTreating pink eye depends on its cause:\n\n### Viral Pink Eye\n\n- Home remedies include **cool compresses** and **artificial tears** to alleviate discomfort.\n- Viral infections often resolve on their own within a week or two.\n- In severe cases, **antiviral** medications may be prescribed.\n\n### Bacterial Pink Eye\n\n- **Antibiotic eye drops** or ointments are commonly used to treat bacterial infections.\n- Symptoms typically improve within a few days of starting treatment.\n- It's important to complete the full course of antibiotics even if symptoms improve early.\n\n### Allergic Eye\n\n- Over-the-counter **antihistamines** can help reduce allergic reactions.\n- **Steroid eye drops** may be prescribed for severe cases.\n- **Avoiding allergens** is crucial to managing symptoms. Practical steps include keeping windows closed during high pollen seasons and using air purifiers.\n\n## Pink Eye vs Allergies: Comparison Table\n\n|  | Infectious Pink Eye | Allergic Conjunctivitis |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cause | Viral or bacterial infection | Allergens |\n| Symptoms | Red or pink eyes<br> Watery/thick discharge<br> Crusty eyelids<br> Blurred vision<br> Swollen lymph nodes (viral) | Itchy, red eyes<br> Clear watery discharge<br> Puffy eyelids<br> Sneezing, runny nose |\n| Treatment | Antiviral medications (viral)<br> Antibiotics (bacterial) | Antihistamines<br> Steroid eye drops |\n| Contagious | Yes | No |\n\n## Hygiene and Preventive Measures\n\n- Wash hands regularly with soap and water.\n- Avoid touching or rubbing the eyes.\n- Do not share personal items like towels, pillows, or makeup.\n- Disinfect surfaces that may be contaminated.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# How can I tell if my toddler has pink eye or allergies?\n\nIf your toddler has red, itchy eyes with clear, watery discharge and additional allergy symptoms like sneezing, it might be allergies. Pink eye, especially if bacterial, often includes a thick, yellow-green discharge and crusty eyelids. If only one eye is initially affected and then spreads to the other, it could be infectious pink eye. Always consult a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What are the key differences between pink eye symptoms and allergy symptoms?\n\nPink eye symptoms include redness, irritation, and discharge that can be watery (viral) or thick and yellow-green (bacterial). Allergic conjunctivitis usually involves both eyes simultaneously with symptoms like intense itchiness, redness, and clear, watery discharge. Allergies are also commonly accompanied by sneezing and a runny nose, which are not typical of pink eye.\n\nHave more questions? [Ask AI Doctor](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/pink-eye-vs-allergies#ask-your-question)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nConjunctivitis, or pink eye, can be caused by viral, bacterial, or allergic reactions, each with distinct symptoms and treatments. Understanding these differences is crucial for proper management.\n\nViral and bacterial pink eye are contagious and often require different treatments, while allergic conjunctivitis is not contagious and is best managed by avoiding allergens and using antihistamines.\n\nProper hygiene and preventive measures can help reduce the spread of infectious pink eye and alleviate allergic conjunctivitis symptoms.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
