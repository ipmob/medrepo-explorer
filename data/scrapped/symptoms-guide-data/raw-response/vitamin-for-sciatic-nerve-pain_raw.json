This nerve runs from the lower back through the hips and buttocks and down each leg. The pain often affects only one side of the body. Common causes of sciatica include:\n\n- **Herniated Discs**: When a disc in the spine presses on the sciatic nerve.\n- **Spinal Stenosis**: Narrowing of the spine that puts pressure on the nerves.\n- [**Piriformis Syndrome**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/piriformis-syndrome-vs-sciatica): When the piriformis muscle irritates the sciatic nerve.\n- **Degenerative Disc Disease**: Wear and tear on the spinal discs.\n- **Injuries**: Trauma or injury to the spine or nerve.\n\n### Symptoms of Sciatica:\n\n- **Sharp Pain**: Radiating from the lower back through the leg.\n- **Numbness**: In the leg or foot along the path of the nerve.\n- **Tingling Sensation**: A pins-and-needles feeling.\n- **Weakness**: In the affected leg or foot.\n\nSciatica can significantly impact daily life, making simple activities like walking, sitting, or standing painful and challenging.\n\nHealthy nerves are crucial for transmitting signals between the brain and the rest of the body. They are protected by a fatty layer called the myelin sheath, which ensures efficient communication. When nerves are damaged or inflamed, this communication is disrupted, leading to pain, weakness, and other symptoms.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Docus AI Symptom Checker\n\nJust 3 simple steps to efficiently understand and manage your health symptoms online.\n\n[Try Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker)\n\n## Essential Vitamins for Sciatica Pain Relief\n\n### Vitamin B12: The Nerve Protector\n\n#### Benefits\n\nVitamin B12 is crucial for maintaining the myelin sheath, which protects nerve fibers.
