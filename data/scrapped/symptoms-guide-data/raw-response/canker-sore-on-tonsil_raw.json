Cleveland Clinic [states](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/10945-canker-sores) that around 20% of people in the U.S. have experienced a canker sore at least once in their lifetime. Most of the time, they will appear along the gums, inside the cheeks, or under the tongue. Sometimes, however, they can occur in less common areas such as the tonsils.\n\nCanker sores on the tonsils are extremely uncomfortable as the tonsils are inside the throat, making treatments more difficult to administer and even more painful for basic activities such as eating and drinking. Commonly, these sores include a white or yellowy center with a red border that may be very painful.\n\nThough canker sores are not contagious, like cold sores, they still disrupt your normal activities and can be pretty frustrating, especially when they appear in sensitive areas around the tonsils. If you're experiencing throat pain and suspect a canker sore, it's important to know what steps to take to manage the pain and speed up healing.\n\n## What Are the Symptoms of a Canker Sore on Tonsil?\n\nA canker sore on your tonsils may be hard to discover during the early stages of development, mostly because the pain can easily be confused with other types of throat conditions, such as [strep throat or tonsillitis](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/tonsillitis-vs-strep-throat). However, a canker sore on the tonsil has typical symptoms that set it apart from other conditions. These include:\n\n- **Throat Pain:** A canker sore on the tonsil often has stabbing or lingering throat pains, especially when swallowing.\n- **Visible Ulcer:** There’s a white sore on the tonsil or a small blister of the tonsil. The sore will usually have a red edge and be oval or round.\n- **Localized Pain:** Unlike other infections, such as tonsillitis, which would attack the throat on both sides, a canker sore usually shows up as a single sore on one tonsil\n- **Burning/Tingling:** You may feel tingling or burning sensations in the area where the sore is about to appear before the sore manifests. This often acts as a warning that the sore will show up.\n- **Difficulty Swallowing:** Depending on the position of the canker sore, eating and even drinking may be painful, especially when acid or spice is present in food.\n\nIf you experience most of the above symptoms it could be a case of a canker sore near the tonsil. While such types of sores are normally harmless and heal by themselves, the pain caused by them makes a significant impact on your normal daily life.\n\nFor those unsure whether the symptoms are from a canker sore or something more serious, the [Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker) tool can help identify the cause of your symptoms. However, it’s important to note that online tools are not a replacement for professional diagnosis.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Docus AI Symptom Checker\n\nJust 3 simple steps to efficiently understand and manage your health symptoms online.\n\n[Try Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker)\n\n## What Causes a Canker Sore on Tonsils?\n\nThe exact cause of the canker sores, including the ones appearing on the tonsils, is unknown. However, several factors trigger and predispose you to these painful ulcers. Common triggers include the following:\n\n- **Food sensitivities:** These are types of food, particularly acidic or spicy ones, like citrus fruits, tomatoes, coffee, and chocolate that irritate your throat and can give you a canker sore.\n- [**Stress**](https://docus.ai/tags/stress) **:** Emotional or physical stress can weaken the immune system and make you prone to sores in the mouth including the tonsils.\n- **Mouth injuries:** It can be an accidental biting of the inside of your cheek, some dental work, which even includes wearing rough dental appliances causing small injuries in the mouth leading to a canker sore.\n- **Hormonal changes:** a shift in hormones, especially due to [menstruation](https://docus.ai/tags/menstruation), may also serve as a prompt for canker sores among others.\n- **Medical Conditions:** Conditions such as celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and Behcet's disease put one at risk of developing canker sores. Sometimes a canker sore that appears on the tonsil may be the symptom of a more serious health issue, for instance, [autoimmune disorders](https://docus.ai/tags/autoimmune-diseases).\n- **Nutritional Deficiency:** A deficiency in some important nutrients like [vitamin B12](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/vitamin-b12), [zinc](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/zinc), [iron](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/iron), or [folate](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/folate-blood-test) may also cause an ulcer on the tonsil.\n\n## How Is Canker Sore on Tonsils Treated?\n\nMost tonsil canker sores will heal without interference in a week or two as [reported](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-long-do-canker-sores-last#timeline) by MedicalNewsToday. However, sometimes it is possible to [get rid of it faster](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/get-rid-of-a-canker-sore-in-24-hours) if treated earlier. There are many treatments and other forms of remedy options available to relieve discomfort and hurry the healing process.\n\n- **Salty Water Rinse:** The most widely available and easy-to-follow remedy is rinsing your mouth with warm saltwater. This will reduce inflammation, clean the sore, and speed up the healing process. Dissolve a teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water and frequently gargle with it throughout the day.\n- **Cold Compress:** The application of cold compressors, or even sucking on pieces of ice, has a job of numbing the pain and swelling around the sore for some time.\n- **Over-the-counter options:** Non-medicated oral rinses, gels, or throat sprays meant for [sore throats](https://docus.ai/tags/sore-throat) can help relieve the pain of a canker sore tonsil. Be sure to use only those products that are extremely gentle and alcohol-free, since this is the best way to avoid causing further irritation.\n- **Dietary changes:** Avoid acidic, spicy, or rough-textured foods that can further inflame the sore. Stick to soft, non-acidic foods such as yogurt, soup, or smoothies so you don't further irritate it.\n- [**Hydration**](https://docus.ai/tags/hydration) **:** Plenty of water intake is a must, as dehydration increases the soreness. Sipping cool or lukewarm water will help throughout the day.\n\n## What Home Remedies Can Help?\n\nApart from conventional treatment, several home remedies can relieve the pain and discomfort caused by a tonsil canker sore. These are all pretty easy to make and, in most instances, require things you'll have in your house.\n\n- **Baking Soda Rinse:** Mix 1 teaspoon of baking soda with 1/2 cup of warm water. Gargling with this solution several times a day may reduce inflammation and speed up the healing process.\n- **Milk of Magnesia:** Dab a little milk of magnesia onto the sore using a cotton swab. This helps neutralize acids in the mouth and calms the sore.\n- **Honey and Aloe Vera:** Honey and aloe vera possess natural healing properties. Dab a little honey or aloe vera gel directly onto the white sore on the tonsil to soothe irritation.\n- **Ice Chips:** Pocketing ice chips will quickly heal the pain by freezing the infected area.\n- **Cold Water Gargles:** Cold water gargling can reduce swelling and prevent stinging while eating and drinking.\n\n**Note:** _These home remedies can relieve the symptoms but are not a professional medical prescription. If the sore is big or does not get better, seek a health professional._\n\n## When Should a Doctor Be Consulted?\n\nMost canker sores on the tonsils heal without professional intervention. However, seek medical help if the sore lasts more than two weeks, is unusually large, or if there are several sores. Severe pain, high [fever](https://docus.ai/tags/fever), difficulty swallowing or breathing, or signs of infection, like pus or spreading redness, also require attention.\n\nIn rare cases, recurrent sores may indicate an underlying health issue, such as an autoimmune disorder, needing further investigation. A healthcare provider can recommend treatments like prescription mouthwashes for more severe cases.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What is the main difference between a canker sore and tonsillitis?\n\nWhile both conditions can cause throat pain, tonsillitis is an infection that affects both sides of the throat and often involves fever and swollen glands. A canker sore, on the other hand, is a small, localized ulcer that typically affects only one side of the tonsil and doesn’t come with symptoms like fever or gland swelling.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# How long does it take for a canker sore on the tonsil to heal?\n\nMost canker sores on the tonsils heal on their own within one to two weeks. However, early treatment and home remedies, such as saltwater rinses or ice chips, can help reduce pain and speed up the healing process.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Can stress cause canker sores on the tonsils?\n\nYes, stress is a well-known trigger for canker sores, including those that appear on the tonsils. Stress can weaken the immune system, making a person more prone to developing these sores.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# When should I see a doctor for a canker sore on my tonsils?\n\nIf the canker sore lasts more than two weeks, is unusually large, or is accompanied by severe pain, difficulty swallowing, or a high fever, it’s important to consult a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\nHave more questions? [Ask AI Doctor](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/canker-sore-on-tonsil#ask-your-question)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCanker sores on the tonsils can be painful and disruptive, but they are usually harmless and heal on their own. Understanding the symptoms, causes, and available treatments can help manage the discomfort and speed up recovery. If symptoms persist or worsen, it's always a good idea to seek medical advice.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
