With its exact cause still unknown, proper diagnosis is key to the right treatment.\n\n![fibromyalgia rash](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2Fd5ea8bfdd56b8bbd70d073de501e94f2.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\nContents\n\n- [What Is Fibromyalgia Rash?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/fibromyalgia-rash#what-is-fibromyalgia-rash)\n- [Causes of Fibromyalgia Rash](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/fibromyalgia-rash#causes-of-fibromyalgia-rash)\n- [Related Skin Conditions in Fibromyalgia](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/fibromyalgia-rash#related-skin-conditions-in-fibromyalgia)\n- [How Is Fibromyalgia Rash Diagnosed?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/fibromyalgia-rash#how-is-fibromyalgia-rash-diagnosed)\n- [How to Treat Fibromyalgia Rash?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/fibromyalgia-rash#how-to-treat-fibromyalgia-rash)\n- [Key Takeaways](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/fibromyalgia-rash#key-takeaways)\n\n## What Is Fibromyalgia Rash?\n\n**Fibromyalgia** is a chronic condition that causes widespread muscle and joint pain, along with fatigue, sleep problems, memory issues, and mood changes. Some people also have skin problems and rash is one of them.\n\nThe **American College of Rheumatology (ACR)** includes rashes in its [2010 criteria](https://rheumatology.org/criteria) as a possible symptom of fibromyalgia. However, a rash alone cannot confirm the diagnosis, as fibromyalgia involves multiple symptoms.\n\nA fibromyalgia rash can vary from person to person. The rash often appears as **red**, **dry**, or **rough patches** on the skin.\n\nOn darker skin tones, the rash may appear as **dark brown**, **grayish**, or **slightly purple** discolorations.\n\nMany people feel **constant itching (pruritus)**, which can be very uncomfortable. Some also experience a **burning** or **stinging feeling** in the rash.\n\nThe rash may appear in areas prone to sweat or irritation, such as the arms, chest, and back.\n\nThese symptoms may come and go, getting worse during flare-ups.\n\n![fibromyalgia rash example](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2F68a615642acb2155fe0aa4add550e777.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n_One of the variants of fibromyalgia rash_\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Your Personal AI Doctor\n\nCustomize your AI Doctor to ask any health-related questions.

Presumably, this is because fibromyalgia affects the nerves, skin, and other body systems, but further research is required.\n\nThese factors can make the skin more sensitive, leading to itching, redness, and discomfort:\n\n- **Neurogenic Inflammation:** Nerve activity causes the release of chemicals like neuropeptides, which disrupt normal skin function.\n- **Autonomic Nervous System Dysfunction:** The system that controls sweating, blood flow, and skin oils may not work properly, leading to dryness and sensitivity.\n- **Systemic Inflammation:** Some [studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39124671/) suggest low levels of inflammation occur in fibromyalgia, making the skin more prone to irritation.\n- **Neurotransmitter Imbalances:** Chemicals like [serotonin](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/serotonin), which help manage pain and skin sensitivity, may be low in fibromyalgia. When their levels are low or disrupted, it can increase skin sensitivity and discomfort.\n\nHeat, stress, sweating, and friction from tight clothing can worsen the rash, especially during flare-ups.\n\nSome medications used to manage fibromyalgia symptoms can also cause skin reactions, including rashes, as side effects. If a rash appears after starting a new medication, it’s important to discuss it with your doctor.\n\n## Related Skin Conditions in Fibromyalgia\n\n[Studies](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11312914/) have identified conditions like **dermographism**, **Raynaud’s phenomenon**, and **hyperhidrosis** as common in fibromyalgia patients:\n\n- [**Dermographism**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK531496/) is a condition where even light scratching causes raised, red lines on the skin. This strong skin response can make the rash more noticeable and increase irritation.\n- [**Raynaud’s phenomenon**](https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/raynauds-phenomenon) reduces blood flow to the skin. It leads to discoloration and sensitivity, especially in the fingers and toes.\n- [**Hyperhidrosis**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459227/), or excessive sweating, is another common issue. It can make the skin damp, which may cause irritation and worsen rashes, especially in areas with friction.\n\nThese conditions may not always happen together but can occur at the same time in fibromyalgia patients and add to overall discomfort.\n\n## How Is Fibromyalgia Rash Diagnosed?\n\nTo diagnose fibromyalgia rash, a person must already have a confirmed fibromyalgia diagnosis.\n\nThe primary goal of evaluating the rash is to rule out other skin conditions, such as **[eczema](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/eczema)**, **psoriasis**, or **[allergic reactions](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/allergy-attack)**, as they can look similar.\n\nDoctors begin with a **clinical examination**, carefully checking the rash’s appearance, location, and pattern to differentiate it from other conditions.\n\nIf necessary, additional **tests** may be done to rule out other skin diseases:\n\n- **Allergy Testing:** To check for reactions to specific substances.\n- **Skin Biopsy:** A small piece of the rash is examined under a microscope to exclude conditions like eczema or psoriasis.\n- [**Blood Tests**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview) **:** These tests help check for [autoimmune conditions](https://docus.ai/tags/autoimmune-diseases) or infections that cause similar rashes.\n\nIf no other skin diseases are confirmed during these examinations and tests, the rash is likely associated with fibromyalgia.\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## How to Treat Fibromyalgia Rash?\n\nThere is no specific cure for fibromyalgia rash, but you can manage the symptoms and improve skin comfort with these steps:\n\n### 1\\. Moisturize the Skin\n\nApply a gentle, fragrance-free moisturizer **twice daily** to hydrate your skin. This helps prevent dryness, itching, and irritation.\n\n### 2\\. Avoid and Track Your Triggers\n\nWear loose, soft fabrics and stay in cool areas, especially during flare-ups.\n\nKeep a diary of when the rash flares up. Note stress levels, activities, clothing, and weather.\n\n### 3\\. Manage Stress\n\nStress can cause flare-ups of fibromyalgia, so use these techniques:\n\n- Practice deep breathing for **5-10 minutes daily**.\n- Spend **10 minutes a day** calming your mind to reduce stress.\n- Do light stretches for **15 minutes** to relax your body and reduce nerve activity.\n- Aim for **7-9 hours** of consistent, restful sleep each night to keep stress levels low.\n- Take a warm bath and get a gentle massage for **15-20 minutes** daily.\n\n### 4\\. Natural Relief Strategies\n\nSome natural methods can soothe skin discomfort:\n\n- **Aloe Vera gel:** Apply to the rash **twice daily** to reduce redness and itching.\n- **Oatmeal baths:** Soak in a lukewarm oatmeal bath for **15-20 minutes** to relieve dry, irritated skin.\n- **Cold compresses:** Use a cold, damp cloth on the rash for **5-10 minutes** to calm burning or swelling.\n- **Essential oils:** Diluted lavender or chamomile oil may soothe the skin, but always check with a professional before use.\n\n### 5\\. Consult a Specialist\n\nIf the rash doesn’t improve or gets worse, consult a **dermatologist** or **rheumatologist**. They can rule out other skin conditions and suggest treatments like medicated creams to reduce symptoms.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Can fibromyalgia rash appear on the face?\n\nYes, fibromyalgia rash can develop on the face, presenting as redness or a flushed appearance. This may be accompanied by stinging sensations or increased skin sensitivity.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Is fibromyalgia rash contagious?\n\nNo, fibromyalgia rash is not contagious. It results from internal factors related to fibromyalgia and does not spread through contact.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Does diet influence fibromyalgia rash?\n\nWhile no specific diet is proven to affect fibromyalgia rash directly, some individuals find that certain foods can influence their overall fibromyalgia symptoms. Keeping a food diary may help identify any personal triggers.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Is fibromyalgia rash a sign of disease progression?\n\nNot necessarily. The presence or severity of a rash does not directly indicate the progression of fibromyalgia. Symptoms can vary widely among individuals.\n\nHave more questions?
