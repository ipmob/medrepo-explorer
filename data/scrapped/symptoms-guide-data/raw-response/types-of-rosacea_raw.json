Each type has specific symptoms and varies in prevalence.\n\n![types of rosacea](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2Ff22c1f977a0f0385b7d5e7338a1be233.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\nContents\n\n- [What is Rosacea?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/types-of-rosacea#what-is-rosacea)\n- [Types of Rosacea](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/types-of-rosacea#types-of-rosacea)\n- [What Causes Rosacea?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/types-of-rosacea#what-causes-rosacea)\n- [Treatment Options for Rosacea](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/types-of-rosacea#treatment-options-for-rosacea)\n- [Conclusion](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/types-of-rosacea#conclusion)\n\n## What is Rosacea?\n\nRosacea is a common chronic skin condition that primarily affects the face. It's characterized by a tendency to blush or flush more easily than others. The condition is **not contagious** but can significantly impact a person's self-esteem and quality of life.\n\nAccording to [MedlinePlus](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/rosacea/#frequency), the prevalence of rosacea varies widely, with estimates ranging from less than **1% to over 20% of the population**, depending on the study population and diagnostic criteria used.\n\nRosacea typically appears as redness on the nose and cheeks, but it can also spread to the chin, forehead, ears, chest, and back. This condition often leads to visible blood vessels and, in some cases, pus-filled spots.\n\nThe impact of rosacea on a person's life can be substantial. The redness and visible symptoms often lead to self-consciousness and can affect social interactions.\n\nMany people with rosacea feel embarrassed or frustrated by their appearance, which can lead to reduced self-esteem. This emotional toll can affect personal and professional relationships, making it essential to understand and manage the condition effectively.\n\n## Types of Rosacea\n\n![4 types of rosacea](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2Fad38a874926ce90ab495ca75cc44cca3.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n### Type 1: Erythematotelangiectactic Rosacea (ERT)\n\nErythematotelangiectactic rosacea, often abbreviated as ERT, is the most common type, with a prevalence of approximately **57%**, according to an [analysis](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2790693#:~:text=Phymatous%20rosacea%20was%20more%20common,women%20based%20on%205%20studies.&text=Ocular%20rosacea%20was%20reported%20at,women%20based%20on%203%20studies.) in JAMA Dermatology.\n\nThis type of rosacea primarily affects the **cheeks**, **nose**, and **forehead**.\n\nAccording to the [National Rosacea Society](https://www.rosacea.org/tags/erythematotelangiectatic-rosacea), scientists have discovered a possible link between the nervous system and the redness and stinging associated with erythematotelangiectatic rosacea.\n\n#### Symptoms of ERT\n\n- Persistent redness in the central face\n- Visible small blood vessels\n- Flushing and blushing easily\n- Swelling and a warm feeling in the affected areas\n\nIf left untreated, ERT can lead to more severe symptoms such as increased skin sensitivity, persistent facial swelling, and more extensive visible blood vessels, resulting in potentially permanent redness.\n\nIt is crucial to seek treatment early to manage the condition and prevent complications.\n\n### Type 2: Papulopustular Rosacea\n\nPapulopustular rosacea, also known as **acne rosacea**, is characterized by large, painful blemishes that form deep within the skin.\n\nThese blemishes are often mistaken for [acne](https://docus.ai/tags/acne), but they differ significantly.\n\nThis type of rosacea usually affects the **central face**, particularly around the nose, but it can spread to the chest and back if left untreated.\n\n#### Symptoms of Papulopustular Rosacea\n\n- Red, swollen bumps and pimples\n- Large, painful blemishes\n- Oily and sensitive skin\n- Burning or stinging sensation in the affected areas\n\nUnlike typical acne, **papulopustular rosacea does not involve blackheads**.\n\nIf untreated, it can lead to persistent skin issues and discomfort, emphasizing the need for proper diagnosis and treatment.\n\n### Type 3: Phymatous Rosacea\n\n[Phymatous rosacea](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/phymatous-rosacea) is the most severe form of rosacea, characterized by the thickening of the skin and a bumpy texture. This type often starts with small plaques or thick, scaly areas of skin.\n\nOver time, it can lead to rhinophyma, a condition where the skin on the nose thickens and becomes bulbous.\n\nAccording to a [publication](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2790693#:~:text=Phymatous%20rosacea%20was%20more%20common,women%20based%20on%205%20studies.&text=Ocular%20rosacea%20was%20reported%20at,women%20based%20on%203%20studies.) in JAMA Dermatology, phymatous rosacea is more prevalent in men, affecting about **29%** of men compared to roughly **4%** of women, based on data from five studies.\n\n#### Symptoms of Phymatous Rosacea\n\n- Thickened, bumpy skin\n- Small plaques or scaly areas\n- Development of rhinophyma (bulbous nose)\n\nUntreated phymatous rosacea can lead to significant cosmetic and psychological issues, making early intervention crucial.\n\n### Type 4: Ocular Rosacea\n\nOcular rosacea **affects the eyes**, leading to red and irritated eyes, swollen eyelids, and a sensation of burning or dryness.\n\nThis type of rosacea can be easily mistaken for other eye conditions like **conjunctivitis** or **blepharitis**, which makes it one of the most misdiagnosed forms.\n\n#### Symptoms of Ocular Rosacea\n\n- Red, irritated eyes\n- Swollen eyelids\n- Watery or burning eyes\n- Dryness and sensitivity to light\n- Blurry vision\n\nThe symptoms of ocular rosacea can sometimes appear without the skin symptoms typical of other types of rosacea. If left untreated, it can lead to more severe eye conditions, including [vision problems](https://docus.ai/tags/vision-problems), making early diagnosis and treatment essential.\n\nUnderstanding the different types of rosacea is crucial for effective management. Early intervention can prevent complications and improve the quality of life for those affected.\n\nIf you are experiencing symptoms of rosacea, consider using Docus AI [Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker) to identify your condition.

Understanding these causes can help manage and prevent flare-ups effectively.\n\n### Genetic Predisposition\n\nCertain genetic factors increase the likelihood of developing rosacea. Individuals with fair skin, particularly those with light-colored hair and eyes, are more prone to this condition. A family history of rosacea also raises the risk, suggesting a hereditary component.\n\nAdditionally, abnormalities in blood vessels and immune responses can contribute to the condition. Specific bacteria, like **Helicobacter pylori** found in the intestines, and skin mites such as **Demodex**, are also linked to rosacea.\n\n### Common Irritants and Triggers\n\nVarious environmental and lifestyle factors can trigger rosacea flare-ups:\n\n- **Alcohol:** Consuming alcoholic beverages can cause blood vessels to dilate, leading to redness and flushing.\n- [**Stress**](https://docus.ai/tags/stress) **:** Emotional stress can exacerbate symptoms.\n- **Extreme temperatures:** Both hot and cold weather can trigger flare-ups.\n- **Spicy foods:** Hot and spicy foods are common triggers.\n- **Sun exposure:** Ultraviolet rays from the sun can worsen rosacea symptoms.\n\nUnderstanding the combination of genetic predisposition and common irritants can help individuals with rosacea take preventive measures and manage their condition more effectively.\n\n## Treatment Options for Rosacea\n\nMayo Clinic [suggests](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rosacea/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353820) these treatment options:\n\n### Medicines\n\nVarious medicines help manage rosacea symptoms, tailored to specific needs such as reducing flushing or treating pimples and bumps:\n\n- **Topical Treatments:** Medicated creams or gels can reduce flushing by constricting blood vessels. Results are usually seen within 12 hours, but the effects are temporary. Overuse can lead to increased flushing, so use them sparingly.\n- **Prescription Topical Products:** These help control pimples and may take a few weeks to show results. Sometimes, combining products yields the best results.\n- **Oral Antibiotics:** For severe rosacea with bumps and pimples, oral antibiotics can help reduce inflammation.\n- **Oral Acne Medication:** For severe cases unresponsive to other treatments, a powerful oral acne medication may be prescribed. This medication is not suitable during pregnancy due to the risk of birth defects.\n\n### Laser Treatment\n\nLaser treatment can improve the appearance of enlarged blood vessels and long-term redness. It is more effective than creams or pills for these symptoms and works best on lighter skin tones.\n\n#### Considerations for Laser Treatment:\n\n- **Consultation:** Discuss risks and benefits with your healthcare provider. Common side effects include temporary redness, bruising, and swelling. Rare side effects might include blistering and scarring.\n- **Skin Tone:** Laser treatment might cause long-term skin color changes in darker skin tones.\n- **Effectiveness:** Full effects take weeks to appear, and multiple sessions may be needed.\n- **Insurance Coverage:** Check with your insurance provider to see if laser treatment is covered, as it is sometimes considered a cosmetic procedure.\n\nExploring these treatment options with a healthcare provider can help manage rosacea symptoms effectively.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What are the Different Types of Rosacea?\n\nRosacea is a chronic skin condition with four main types: erythematotelangiectactic, papulopustular, phymatous, and ocular.
