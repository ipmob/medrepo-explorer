It occurs due to the buildup of [uric acid](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/uric-acid) in the blood, which forms sharp, needle-like crystals in and around the joints. These crystals trigger intense inflammation and pain, often starting in the big toe but potentially affecting other parts such as the [heels](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/gout-in-heel), [ankles](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/gout-in-ankle), [knees](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/gout-in-knee), [shoulders](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/gout-in-shoulder), [elbows](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/gout-in-elbow), [hands](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/gout-in-hand), and fingers.\n\n### Causes of Gout\n\nGout develops when the body accumulates too much uric acid. Uric acid is produced during the breakdown of purines, substances found in certain foods and drinks, including **red meat**, **seafood**, and **alcohol**. Normally, uric acid dissolves in the blood and is excreted through the kidneys.\n\nHowever, when the body **produces too much uric acid** or the kidneys do not eliminate enough, it accumulates and forms crystals, leading to gout.\n\n### Symptoms of Gout\n\n- **Severe Joint Pain**: Intense pain typically [starts at night](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/how-to-stop-gout-pain-at-night) and can last for hours.\n- **Inflammation and Redness**: Affected joints become swollen, tender, and red.\n- **Limited Range of Motion**: As gout progresses, joint movement can become restricted.\n- **Recurrent Attacks**: After the initial flare-up, symptoms may subside but often recur, affecting more joints over time.\n\n## Risk Factors for Gout\n\n### Genetic Factors\n\nGout can run in families, indicating a genetic predisposition. If someone in your family has a history of gout, your risk of developing the condition is higher. Genetic factors influence how your body processes uric acid, making you more susceptible to gout.\n\n### Lifestyle Factors\n\n- **Diet**: Consuming foods high in purines, such as red meat, seafood, and sugary drinks, increases uric acid levels. Alcohol, particularly beer, can also contribute to gout.\n- **Weight**: Being overweight increases the production of uric acid and reduces the kidneys' ability to eliminate it.\n- **Exercise**: Lack of physical activity can contribute to weight gain and elevated uric acid levels.\n\n### Health Conditions\n\n- **High Blood Pressure**: Uncontrolled hypertension is linked to higher uric acid levels.\n- **Kidney Disease**: Impaired kidney function affects uric acid excretion.\n- **[Diabetes](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/diabetes) and Metabolic Syndrome**: These conditions are associated with higher uric acid levels.\n- **Medications**: Diuretics and low-dose aspirin can elevate uric acid levels.\n\n### Other Factors\n\n- **Age and Sex [risks](https://www.arthritis.org/gout-patient-education) from Arthritis Foundation**: Men are more likely to develop gout, typically between the ages of 30 and 50. Women's risk increases after [menopause](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/about-menopause).\n- **Recent Surgery or Trauma**: These can trigger gout attacks by increasing uric acid levels.\n- **Chemotherapy**: The breakdown of tumor cells during treatment can lead to elevated uric acid levels, triggering gout.\n\n## Diagnosing Gout\n\nRecognizing gout symptoms is essential for effective treatment, and [online tools can help identify these symptoms](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker/symptom-checker-for-adults/arthritis) early. Common signs include sudden, intense joint pain, usually starting at night.\n\n- **Physical Examination**: Checking for signs of inflammation and tenderness in the joints.\n- **Medical History Review**: Discussing your symptoms, diet, and family history.\n- [**Blood Tests**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview): Measuring uric acid levels in the blood.\n- **Joint Fluid Test**: Detecting uric acid crystals in the joint fluid.\n- **Imaging Tests**: X-rays, ultrasounds, or CT scans to identify joint damage and crystal deposits.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Docus AI Symptom Checker\n\nJust 3 simple steps to efficiently understand and manage your health symptoms online.\n\n[Try Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker)\n\n## Non-Surgical Treatments for Gout\n\n### Medications\n\nTo treat gout attacks and prevent future episodes, doctors often prescribe:\n\n- **Anti-Inflammatory Drugs**: These medications help reduce inflammation and pain during gout attacks.\n- **Corticosteroids**: These are used to control severe inflammation quickly.\n- **Uric Acid-Lowering Medications**: These drugs help reduce uric acid levels in the blood, preventing the formation of gout crystals.\n- **Colchicine**: This medication was approved by the [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/colchicine-marketed-colcrys-information) to be used to treat acute gout attacks and can also be taken in lower doses to prevent future attacks.\n\n**Warning**: _This information is intended solely for informational purposes. Only use colchicine if it has been prescribed by a doctor and under their supervision to ensure safety and effectiveness. Always consult a healthcare professional before beginning any new medication._\n\n### Lifestyle Changes and Preventive Measures\n\n- **Diet**: Avoid foods high in purines such as red meat, seafood, and sugary beverages. Opt for a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.\n- **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water to help flush uric acid from your body. Aim for at least 8 glasses a day.\n- **Exercise**: Engage in regular, low-impact exercises like walking, swimming, or cycling to maintain joint health and manage weight.\n- **Weight Management**: Maintain a healthy weight to reduce the burden on your joints and lower uric acid levels.\n- **Stress Management:** Reducing stress through relaxation techniques like yoga, meditation, and adequate sleep can help prevent gout flare-ups.\n\n## When to Consider Surgery for Gout\n\nIn some cases, non-surgical treatments for gout may not be sufficient, and surgery may become necessary. Here are the criteria for considering surgery:\n\n### Criteria for Surgery\n\n- **Chronic Pain**: Persistent and severe pain that doesn't respond to medications and lifestyle changes.\n- **Joint Deformity**: Significant deformity or damage to the joint caused by long-term gout.\n- **Infected Tophi**: Hard deposits of uric acid, known as tophi, that become infected or ulcerate.\n\n### Chronic Tophaceous Gout\n\nChronic tophaceous gout is a severe form of gout that develops over years if the condition is not managed effectively. This stage is characterized by the formation of large tophi around the joints and in soft tissues. These deposits can cause severe joint damage, deformity, and functional impairment. Tophi can also break through the skin, leading to infections and ulcers, making everyday activities extremely painful and challenging.\n\nIf you experience any of these severe symptoms, it's essential to consult with a healthcare provider. They can assess your condition and determine whether surgery is a necessary step.\n\n## Types of Gout Surgery\n\nWhen non-surgical treatments are ineffective, several surgical options can help manage severe gout symptoms and improve joint function.\n\n### Arthroscopic Gout Removal\n\n#### Procedure\n\nArthroscopic gout removal is a **minimally invasive surgery** used to remove uric acid crystals from the joints. Small incisions are made around the affected joint, and a tiny camera (arthroscope) is inserted to guide the surgeon. The surgeon then uses specialized instruments to remove the gout crystals and clean the joint.\n\n#### Benefits\n\nThis procedure can relieve pain, **improve joint function**, and has a shorter recovery time compared to open surgery.\n\n#### Recovery\n\nPatients can usually resume normal activities within **a few weeks**. Small puncture wounds heal within a few days, but active individuals should wait a few weeks before resuming athletic activities.\n\n### Tophi Removal Surgery\n\n#### Indications\n\nTophi removal surgery is recommended when **tophi become painful**, inflamed, or infected, or cause significant joint deformity and functional impairment.\n\n#### Procedure\n\nThe surgery involves making an incision over the affected area and carefully **removing the tophi while preserving as much surrounding tissue** as possible. In cases where large amounts of tissue are removed, a skin graft may be necessary to aid healing.\n\n#### Recovery\n\nRecovery time varies depending on the **size** and **number** of tophi removed. Generally, it takes **several weeks to a few months** to fully recover. Patients should follow their doctor’s instructions for wound care and activity restrictions to ensure proper healing.\n\n### Joint Fusion Surgery\n\n#### Benefits and Risks\n\nJoint fusion, or arthrodesis, involves **fusing the bones** in a joint together to increase stability and reduce pain. This surgery is typically used for **smaller joints**. While it can effectively relieve pain, it results in loss of joint mobility.\n\n#### Recovery\n\nRecovery from joint fusion surgery can take **up to 12 weeks**. Physical therapy is often recommended to maintain the health of surrounding joints and improve overall mobility.\n\n### Joint Replacement Surgery\n\n#### Procedure\n\nJoint replacement surgery involves **removing the damaged joint** and replacing it with an artificial one. This is most commonly performed on **larger joints** like the knee or hip.\n\n#### Suitable Candidates\n\nPatients with severe joint damage and **significant pain** that affects their daily activities are considered suitable candidates for this surgery.\n\n#### Rehabilitation\n\nRecovery can take around **six weeks or more**. Initially, patients may need help with daily activities. Rehabilitation involves physical therapy to regain muscle strength, range of motion, and mobility. Full recovery can take several months, depending on the individual's overall health and adherence to the rehabilitation program.\n\n## Recovery and Aftercare\n\n### Post-Surgery Care\n\n- **Rest and Elevation**: Keep the affected joint elevated and rest as much as possible to reduce swelling and promote healing.\n- **Wound Care**: Follow your doctor’s instructions for wound care to prevent infections. Keep the surgical site clean and dry, and change dressings as advised.\n- **Pain Management**: Take prescribed pain medications as directed to manage post-surgery pain effectively.\n\n### Physical Therapy\n\n- **Mobility and Strength**: Physical therapy helps restore joint mobility and strengthen surrounding muscles, improving overall function.\n- **Personalized Exercise Plans**: Therapists provide tailored exercise programs to meet individual needs, ensuring a safe and effective recovery.\n- **Preventing Stiffness**: Regular physical therapy sessions prevent stiffness and enhance flexibility.\n\n### Support System\n\n- **Assistance with Daily Activities**: Arrange for help with daily tasks such as cooking, cleaning, and transportation.\n- **Emotional Support**: Emotional encouragement from family and friends can boost morale and aid in a faster recovery.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What are the best non-surgical methods for gout removal?\n\nGout removal primarily involves managing uric acid levels through medications and lifestyle changes.
