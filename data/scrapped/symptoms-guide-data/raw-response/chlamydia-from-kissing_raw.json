It affects both men and women and can be transmitted through various forms of sexual contact. The infection often goes unnoticed because it frequently doesn't cause symptoms, making regular testing essential for sexually active individuals.\n\nIn terms of prevalence, chlamydia is one of the most reported STIs globally. It is particularly common among young adults and teenagers. [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2022/overview.htm) reports that in 2022, more than **1.5 million** cases of Chlamydia trachomatis infection were reported, making it the most common nationally notifiable sexually transmitted infection in the United States for that year.\n\nOn top of that, chlamydia can have serious health consequences if left untreated, including **infertility** and an increased risk of other infections.\n\n## Can You Get Chlamydia from Kissing?\n\n**No, you cannot get chlamydia from mouth-to-mouth kissing.** Chlamydia is not spread through saliva or casual physical contact. This means that activities like kissing, hugging, or sharing utensils do not pose a risk of transmitting the infection.\n\nChlamydia is caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis, which primarily infects the genital areas. It requires direct contact with infected genital fluids to spread. Therefore, the main transmission route is unprotected sex with an infected person.\n\n## How is Chlamydia Transmitted?\n\nThe bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis resides in genital fluids, making direct sexual contact the main mode of transmission. Here are the key ways chlamydia can be spread:\n\n- **Unprotected Vaginal, Anal, or Oral Sex:** Engaging in sex without using condoms significantly increases the risk of transmission.\n- **Sharing Sex Toys:** If sex toys are not properly cleaned or covered with a new condom between uses, they can transfer the bacteria from one person to another.\n- **Genital Contact with Infected Fluids:** Even without penetration, genital contact with infected fluids can result in transmission.\n- **During Childbirth:** An infected mother can pass the infection to her baby during delivery, potentially causing eye infections or [pneumonia](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/pneumonia) in the newborn.\n\n## Symptoms of Chlamydia\n\nAccording to the [ECDC](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/chlamydia/facts#:~:text=Chlamydia%20infections%20(genital)&text=Many%20infections%20are%20asymptomatic%20resulting,cause%20of%20pelvic%20inflammatory%20disease.), chlamydia often presents without noticeable symptoms, which is why it is sometimes called a \" **silent**\" infection. The infection can remain [dormant for weeks or even months](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/how-long-can-chlamydia-be-dormant), making it difficult to detect without regular screening. When symptoms do occur, they can vary between men and women.\n\n### Common Symptoms in Women:\n\n- Painful urination.\n- Abnormal vaginal [discharge](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/what%20does%20chlamydia%20discharge%20look%20like#descriptions-and-comparisons-of-chlamydia-discharge).\n- Pain during intercourse.\n- Bleeding between periods or after sex.\n\n### Common Symptoms in Men:\n\n- Painful urination.\n- [Discharge from the penis](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/what%20does%20chlamydia%20discharge%20look%20like).\n- Pain and swelling in the testicles.\n\nSince many people with chlamydia do not show any symptoms, regular screening is essential, especially for sexually active individuals under 25 or those with new or multiple partners.\n\nFor those unsure about their symptoms, the [Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker) can be a helpful tool to identify potential health issues. Remember, online tools are not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult a professional before taking any action.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Docus AI Symptom Checker\n\nJust 3 simple steps to efficiently understand and manage your health symptoms online.\n\n[Try Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker)\n\n## Diagnosis and Treatment of Chlamydia\n\nChlamydia is diagnosed through [urine tests](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/urinalysis-test) and [swab tests](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/swab-test), which can be done at a clinic or with a home testing kit. A urine sample or a swab from the affected area (such as the cervix or urethra) is analyzed for the presence of Chlamydia trachomatis bacteria.\n\nIn addition to healthcare provider consultation, you can upload your [**Urine**](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation/urinalysis) or [**Swab**](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation/swab-test) test results to Docus AI Doctor for quick and easy-to-understand interpretation.\n\nTreatment for chlamydia typically involves **antibiotics**. These medications are highly effective and should be taken **only when prescribed by a doctor**. They usually clear the infection within **one to two weeks**. It is important to complete the full course of antibiotics even if symptoms improve earlier.\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## Prevention Tips\n\nPreventing chlamydia involves practicing safe sex and taking proactive measures to reduce the risk of transmission. Here are some practical tips:\n\n- **Use Condoms:** Always use condoms for vaginal, anal, and oral sex. Condoms are highly effective at reducing the risk of chlamydia and other STIs.\n- **Use Dental Dams:** For oral sex involving female genitals, use dental dams to create a barrier and prevent the spread of infections.\n- **Avoid Sharing Sex Toys:** Do not share sex toys, or if you do, ensure they are thoroughly cleaned and covered with a new condom between each use.\n- **Routine Testing:** Regular screening is crucial, especially for sexually active individuals under 25 or those with new or multiple partners. Early detection can prevent complications and further spread.\n- **Communication and Responsibility:** Openly discuss sexual health with your partners. Ensure both of you are aware of each other’s STI status and are committed to safe sex practices.\n\n## Myths and Misconceptions about Chlamydia and STIs\n\n### Common Myths about Chlamydia:\n\n- **Myth:** You can get chlamydia from a toilet seat.\n\n**Fact:** Chlamydia cannot survive on surfaces like toilet seats. It requires direct sexual contact to be transmitted.\n- **Myth:** Only promiscuous people get chlamydia.\n\n**Fact:** Anyone who is sexually active can get chlamydia, regardless of the number of partners they have.\n- **Myth:** You can’t get chlamydia if you use condoms.\n\n**Fact:** While condoms significantly reduce the risk, no method is 100% effective except abstinence. “ _Condoms cover only the penis, but we see herpes sores in places outside the covered area, like on thighs and buttocks_”, [notes](https://www.rush.edu/news/6-surprising-facts-about-stds) Marsha Gorens, MD gynecologist at Rush University Medical Center.\n\n### Addressing Misconceptions:\n\n- **Misconception:** Chlamydia always has symptoms.\n\n**Correction:** Many people with chlamydia do not show any symptoms, which is why regular testing is crucial.\n- **Misconception:** You can only get chlamydia from vaginal sex.\n\n**Correction:** Chlamydia can also be transmitted through anal and oral sex, as well as genital contact without penetration, along with vaginal health.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Can you get chlamydia from kissing?\n\nNo, you cannot get chlamydia from mouth-to-mouth kissing. Chlamydia is not spread through saliva but rather through direct contact with infected genital fluids during vaginal, anal, or oral sex.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Can you get throat chlamydia from kissing?\n\nChlamydia in the throat, or oropharyngeal chlamydia, is not typically spread through kissing. It is usually contracted through oral sex with an infected partner, where genital fluids come into contact with the mouth and throat.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Can you get chlamydia from tongue kissing?\n\nTongue kissing, or deep kissing, does not transmit chlamydia. The bacteria that cause chlamydia require direct contact with infected genital fluids, which does not occur through tongue kissing.\n\nHave more questions? [Ask AI Doctor](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/chlamydia-from-kissing#ask-your-question)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nChlamydia cannot be transmitted through a kiss. Chlamydia is primarily spread through unprotected vaginal, anal, or oral sex.\n\nRegular screenings, safe sex practices, and open communication with partners are essential in preventing and managing this common STI. Always consult a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
