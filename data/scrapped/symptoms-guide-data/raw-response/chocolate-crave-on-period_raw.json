Chocolate cravings during menstruation are incredibly common, but why does it happen?\n\nThese cravings are often caused by hormonal changes, serotonin dips, and magnesium needs. Choosing healthier options can help manage cravings and support your body during this time.\n\n![why do i crave chocolate on my period](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2F6d07c3d5f0a916e26375e0cae5139f89.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\nContents\n\n- [Why Do You Crave Chocolate on Your Period?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/chocolate-crave-on-period#why-do-you-crave-chocolate-on-your-period)\n- [What About Other Sugary Foods?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/chocolate-crave-on-period#what-about-other-sugary-foods)\n- [Should You Give In to Your Cravings?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/chocolate-crave-on-period#should-you-give-in-to-your-cravings)\n- [What Are the Healthier Alternatives to Chocolate and Sugary Foods?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/chocolate-crave-on-period#what-are-the-healthier-alternatives-to-chocolate-and-sugary-foods)\n- [Conclusion](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/chocolate-crave-on-period#conclusion)\n\n## Why Do You Crave Chocolate on Your Period?\n\n### Hormonal Changes\n\nYour menstrual cycle brings natural changes to your hormones, which can directly affect your mood and appetite.\n\n- During the **luteal phase** (the days leading up to your period), [**progesterone**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/progesterone) levels increase,  to prepare the uterine lining for potential pregnancy. It makes you feel hungrier.\n- [Research](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2020.00311/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com) shows that [**cortisol levels**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/cortisol#cortisol-levels), often called the **stress hormone**, can rise during menstruation. Higher cortisol can make you feel more anxious or stressed, which may trigger cravings for comfort foods to help you feel calmer.\n- At the same time, [**serotonin levels**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/serotonin#what-are-the-normal-serotonin-levels)—your body’s “feel-good” hormone—drop. Lower serotonin can leave you feeling low, tired, or irritable. To boost serotonin quickly, your body often craves foods that trigger its production—like chocolate!\n\nChocolate, especially the sugary kind, helps release [**dopamine**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/dopamine), a hormone that brings feelings of pleasure and satisfaction.\n\nThis combination makes chocolate a popular go-to food for comfort during this time.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Your Personal AI Doctor\n\nCustomize your AI Doctor to ask any health-related questions. Get instant answers and tailored health insights.\n\n[Get Started](https://docus.ai/ai-doctor)\n\n### Nutritional Deficiency\n\nYour body may also be signaling a need for certain nutrients during your period. One key nutrient is [**magnesium**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/magnesium). It is a mineral that helps reduce muscle cramps and support mood regulation.\n\n- Chocolate, especially **dark chocolate**, is naturally rich in **magnesium**. It can help meet this need and soothe some period symptoms, like cramps and irritability.\n- Chocolate contains [**calcium**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/calcium) and **copper**, which help your body produce endorphins and serotonin—two chemicals that improve mood and reduce pain naturally.\n\nWhen you’re craving chocolate, your body might be instinctively seeking these nutrients to feel better.\n\n### Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)\n\nDid you know your body uses more energy during menstruation?\n\nThis is because your **basal metabolic rate (BMR)**—the amount of energy your body needs to perform basic functions— **increases** slightly.\n\n[Research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12828798/) suggests that your body burns an additional **100 to 300** calories per day during the week leading up to your period.\n\nAs your body works harder to prepare for menstruation, you might feel hungrier and crave **calorie-dense foods** like chocolate.\n\n_\"After all, a period involves shedding the womb lining which requires energy!”_, [notes](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/body/health/a33823341/hungry-on-period/) Obstetrician-Gynecologist Dr. Henderson.\n\nChocolate is high in both **carbohydrates** and **fats**, which provide a quick energy boost to meet these rising energy demands.\n\nThis natural rise in BMR can make cravings feel stronger and more persistent, especially when combined with hormonal changes and serotonin dips.\n\n### Emotional Comfort\n\nLet’s face it—PMS (Premenstrual Syndrome) and menstruation itself can be tough. Mood swings, irritability, and stress are all common symptoms that can leave you reaching for comfort foods.\n\nChocolate isn’t just about its nutrients; it’s also about how it makes you feel.\n\nEating chocolate is often associated with **self-care** and a moment of indulgence. It provides a quick mood boost, which can feel like a small escape during a challenging time.\n\nThe act of eating chocolate can be soothing. It’s a simple way to treat yourself when you need a little extra comfort.\n\n## What About Other Sugary Foods?\n\nPeople often crave other sweet foods for the **same reasons** they crave chocolate—hormonal changes, mood swings, and the need for a quick energy boost.\n\nHowever, unlike chocolate, most sugary foods **lack the additional nutrients** that can actually help your body during this time.\n\nOther sugary treats—like candy, pastries, or soda—may satisfy your cravings temporarily, but they don’t offer the same benefits. Instead, they provide a quick sugar rush that can lead to energy crashes or leave you feeling bloated.\n\n## Should You Give In to Your Cravings?\n\n_“Listening to your hunger cues and appetite is always a good thing to do, as it can help us to fuel our body for the activity it is doing as well as understand when we are full,”_ [says](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/articles/periods) dietitian Ro Huntriss.\n\nIt’s perfectly normal to crave chocolate during your period, and giving **in moderation** can be beneficial. Small amounts of **dark chocolate** can help soothe cramps, lift your mood, and provide nutrients like magnesium.\n\nIf you’d rather not overindulge, you can always opt for **healthier alternatives** that satisfy your cravings without compromising balance.\n\n## What Are the Healthier Alternatives to Chocolate and Sugary Foods?\n\nWhile chocolate and sugary snacks are tempting, there are healthier options that can satisfy your cravings **and** support your body during your period:\n\n- **Fresh Fruits**: Sweet fruits like **bananas**, **dates**, and **berries** offer natural sugars for energy, plus vitamins, minerals, and fiber to keep you feeling full longer.\n- **Nuts and Seeds**: Almonds, cashews, or pumpkin seeds are great snacks. They’re rich in **healthy fats, magnesium, and protein**, which can curb cravings and provide steady energy.\n- **Smoothies**: Blend fruits like bananas or mangoes with **nut butter** or a handful of spinach. This combination gives you natural sweetness and extra nutrients, without the sugar spike.\n- **Greek Yogurt with Honey or Fruit**: Creamy yogurt provides **protein** and calcium, while a touch of honey or fruit adds a hint of sweetness without refined sugar.\n- **Oats or Whole-Grain Snacks**: Foods like oatmeal with a drizzle of honey or whole-grain crackers paired with nut butter provide slow-releasing energy, helping you avoid sugar crashes.\n\nBy choosing these nutrient-dense alternatives, you satisfy your cravings and give your body the support it needs during your period.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Why do I crave chocolate and salt on my period?\n\nCravings for chocolate and salty foods during your period are linked to hormonal changes and energy needs. As progesterone rises and serotonin drops, your body looks for quick ways to boost mood and energy. Chocolate helps with serotonin production, while salty foods may signal a need to balance fluids or sodium levels.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What not to eat during your period?\n\nIt’s best to avoid overly processed, salty, and sugary foods, as they can cause bloating, energy crashes, and worsen period symptoms. Caffeine and fried foods can also increase discomfort, so it’s helpful to stick to nutrient-rich options that keep you energized.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Does dark chocolate really help with period cramps?\n\nYes, it can! Dark chocolate is rich in magnesium, a mineral that relaxes muscles and reduces cramps. It also triggers endorphins, which act as natural pain relievers. Choosing dark chocolate with at least 70% cocoa ensures you get the benefits without too much sugar.\n\nHave more questions?

Enjoy chocolate in moderation and choose healthier options to feel your best.\n\n#### Sources\n\nThis article was reviewed by leading experts in gynecology.
