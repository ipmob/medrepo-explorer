The median nerve is responsible for providing sensation to the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and part of the ring finger. It also controls some of the muscles that allow the thumb to move.\n\nAccording to the [AMA](https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/what-doctors-wish-patients-knew-about-carpal-tunnel-syndrome), carpal tunnel syndrome is one of the most common nerve disorders, affecting about **10 million people** in the US.\n\n### Causes of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome\n\nCTS can be caused by various factors that lead to swelling or irritation of the tendons within the carpal tunnel, putting pressure on the median nerve. According to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4005-carpal-tunnel-syndrome), these factors include:\n\n- **Repetitive hand movements:** Activities that involve repetitive wrist and hand movements, such as typing or using tools, can increase the risk of developing CTS.\n- **Wrist injuries:** Fractures or sprains can cause swelling and narrow the carpal tunnel.\n- **Medical conditions:** Conditions like [diabetes](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/diabetes), rheumatoid arthritis, and thyroid imbalances are linked to a higher risk of CTS.\n- **Genetics:** Some people are born with a naturally smaller carpal tunnel, which increases the likelihood of [nerve compression](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/nerve-compression-syndrome).\n- [**Arthritis**](https://docus.ai/tags/arthritis): Inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis can cause swelling and changes in the tissues around the wrist, increasing the likelihood of CTS.\n- **Ganglion Cysts**: These noncancerous lumps that develop along the tendons or joints of your wrists and hands can press on the median nerve within the carpal tunnel, leading to symptoms of CTS.\n\n### Symptoms\n\nThe symptoms of CTS usually develop gradually and can worsen over time if not addressed. [John Hopkins Medicine](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/carpal-tunnel-syndrome) lists the most common symptoms:\n\n- **Numbness and** [**tingling**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/fingertips-tingling) **:** These sensations often occur in the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and part of the ring finger. Many people report that their symptoms are worse at night, possibly due to wrist positioning during sleep.\n- **Pain in the wrist or hand:** Pain may extend from the wrist up to the forearm or even the shoulder. It is often aggravated by activities that involve gripping or flexing the wrist and can worsen at night.\n- **Weakness in the hand:** Individuals with CTS may find it difficult to perform tasks that require fine motor skills, such as buttoning a shirt. In severe cases, they may even drop objects due to weakened grip strength.\n- **Swollen Feeling in the Fingers**: Many people with CTS describe a sensation of swelling in the fingers, even though visible swelling may not be present. This \"swollen\" feeling can contribute to discomfort and difficulty in hand movement.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Docus AI Symptom Checker\n\nJust 3 simple steps to efficiently understand and manage your health symptoms online.\n\n[Try Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker)\n\n## Why Misdiagnosis Happens\n\nCTS shares symptoms with several other conditions that affect the hand and wrist, making it easy to misdiagnose. For example, both CTS and certain forms of arthritis can cause hand pain and numbness. Additionally, tendonitis can mimic the symptoms of CTS, particularly when it affects the tendons in the wrist.\n\nMisdiagnosis is common because the symptoms of CTS overlap with those of other conditions, and without a proper diagnosis, patients may receive ineffective treatments.\n\n## Common Conditions Misdiagnosed for CTS\n\nUnderstanding the conditions that are frequently mistaken for carpal tunnel syndrome is crucial for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.\n\n### Rheumatoid Arthritis\n\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an [autoimmune disease](https://docus.ai/tags/autoimmune-diseases) that primarily targets the joints, causing inflammation, pain, and swelling. It affects about **1.5 million** Americans, as per the [Arthritis Foundation](https://www.arthritis.org/getmedia/73a9f02d-7f91-4084-91c3-0ed0b11c5814/abtn-2020-final.pdf).\n\nUnlike osteoarthritis, which results from wear and tear, RA occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the body’s tissues, including the joints in the hands and wrists.\n\n#### Symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis\n\nThe symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can be distinct, but they often affect the wrists and hands, which can sometimes lead to confusion with other conditions. Here are the symptoms:\n\n- Pain and swelling in multiple joints, particularly in the hands, wrists, and fingers.\n- Morning stiffness lasting longer than 30 minutes.\n- Symmetrical joint pain, meaning both hands or both wrists are usually affected.\n- [Fatigue](https://docus.ai/tags/fatigue), low-grade [fever](https://docus.ai/tags/fever), and overall feeling of being unwell.\n\n#### Why It’s Misdiagnosed as CTS\n\nRheumatoid arthritis is often misdiagnosed as CTS because both conditions can cause **hand pain** and **numbness**. However, RA tends to affect multiple joints and is accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fatigue and fever, which are not present in CTS. Additionally, RA-related pain is more likely to be **symmetrical**, affecting both hands equally, whereas CTS often **starts in one hand**.\n\n### Tendonitis\n\nTendonitis is the inflammation of a tendon, the fibrous tissue that connects muscle to bone. When tendonitis occurs in the wrist or hand, it can cause pain and limit the range of motion, making it difficult to use the hand for everyday tasks.\n\n#### Symptoms of Tendonitis\n\nTendonitis causes discomfort in the hand and wrist by affecting the tendons, with symptoms such as:\n\n- Localized pain along the affected tendon, often worsening with movement.\n- Swelling and tenderness in the area of inflammation.\n- Stiffness in the hand or wrist, especially in the morning or after periods of inactivity.\n- A sensation of creaking or grating in the tendon during movement.\n\n#### Why It’s Misdiagnosed as CTS\n\nTendonitis is often confused with CTS because both conditions can cause wrist pain and discomfort during hand use. However, tendonitis typically causes localized pain in a specific area of the wrist or hand, while CTS symptoms are more widespread and related to nerve compression.\n\nFor those unsure about their condition, using an online [Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker) can provide initial guidance, though it should not replace professional medical advice.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that this tool is not a substitute for professional medical advice. Always consult a healthcare provider for a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Docus AI Symptom Checker\n\nJust 3 simple steps to efficiently understand and manage your health symptoms online.\n\n[Try Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker)\n\n## Other Conditions That Could Be Misdiagnosed as CTS\n\nThere are several other conditions that can be mistaken for CTS due to similar symptoms:\n\n- **Cervical Radiculopathy**: A condition caused by compression or irritation of nerves in the cervical spine, leading to radiating pain, weakness, numbness, or tingling in the hand and arm. Symptoms may overlap with those of CTS but are typically related to issues in the neck rather than the wrist or hand.\n- **Osteoarthritis:** A degenerative joint disease that causes pain and stiffness in the hand and wrist. Unlike CTS, osteoarthritis pain is usually localized to the joints and may involve visible swelling and reduced range of motion.\n- [**Gout**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/gout-overview) **:** A form of arthritis caused by the buildup of uric acid crystals in the joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, often in the hands. Gout attacks can mimic CTS symptoms but are typically more intense and localized to specific joints.\n- **Diabetic Neuropathy:** Nerve damage caused by [diabetes](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/diabetes), leading to symptoms like numbness, tingling, and pain in the hands. Diabetic neuropathy usually affects both hands and may also impact other areas of the body.\n\n## How to Accurately Diagnose Carpal Tunnel Syndrome\n\nAccurate diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome is essential for ensuring that you receive the correct treatment and avoid unnecessary procedures. Since CTS shares symptoms with several other conditions, a thorough evaluation is required to pinpoint the exact cause of your discomfort.\n\nHealthcare providers use a variety of tools and tests to diagnose CTS accurately. Some of the most common methods include:\n\n- **Physical Exam:** During a physical exam, your doctor will check for signs of CTS, such as numbness in the fingers, weakness in the hand, and tenderness in the wrist. They may perform specific tests like the Tinel’s sign, where tapping on the median nerve in the wrist causes tingling, or the Phalen’s test, where bending the wrist causes symptoms to appear.\n- **Electrodiagnostic Studies:** These tests measure the electrical activity in the muscles and nerves to determine if the median nerve is functioning properly. **Nerve conduction studies** and **electromyography (EMG)** are common electrodiagnostic tests used to confirm a CTS diagnosis and assess the severity of the condition.\n- **Imaging Tests:** While not always necessary, imaging tests like **ultrasound** or **MRI** can be used to visualize the structures in the wrist and rule out other causes of symptoms, such as a cyst or a tumor compressing the median nerve.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCarpal tunnel syndrome is a common condition that can significantly impact your quality of life if not properly diagnosed and treated. By understanding the symptoms and how they differ from similar conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and tendonitis, you can take proactive steps to manage your health.\n\nAlways seek professional medical advice to ensure you receive the appropriate care.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
