It is also known as Indian ginseng or winter cherry. This herb is well-regarded in the medical community for its adaptogenic properties, which help the body cope with stress and maintain balance.\n\nMedically, ashwagandha is rich in bioactive compounds like withanolides, which have anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and anti-stress properties. These compounds help reduce [cortisol levels](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/cortisol#cortisol-levels), mitigating the effects of chronic stress.\n\nAshwagandha also contains alkaloids and saponins, adding to its therapeutic benefits. In clinical settings, it supports mental health, improves cognitive function, and boosts overall vitality, enhancing brain function, memory, reaction times, and physical performance.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Your Personal AI Doctor\n\nCustomize your AI Doctor to ask any health-related questions.

According to [Gallup](https://news.gallup.com/poll/224336/eight-americans-afflicted-stress.aspx), **8 in 10** Americans encounter stress every day. [APA](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2022/concerned-future-inflation) reports that **76%** of adults experiencing stress also suffer from related symptoms such as **headaches (38%)**, **[fatigue](https://docus.ai/tags/fatigue) (35%)**, **nervousness or [anxiety](https://docus.ai/tags/anxiety) (34%)**, and/or feelings of **depression or sadness (33%)**.\n\nWhen the body experiences stress, it produces higher levels of **cortisol**, a hormone that can disrupt the balance of other hormones, including those related to sexual function.\n\nHigh cortisol levels can lead to decreased **libido**, **erectile dysfunction**, and overall reduced **sexual performance**. Common causes of stress-related sexual health issues include work pressure, financial problems, and relationship conflicts. These factors can create a cycle of stress and anxiety that further exacerbates sexual health problems.\n\n### Ashwagandha as an Adaptogen for Reducing Stress\n\nAshwagandha is classified as an **adaptogen**, a natural substance that helps the body adapt to stress and normalize bodily processes. According to the NCBI [publication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4270108/), adaptogens like ashwagandha work by modulating the stress response and reducing cortisol levels. This helps **restore hormonal balance** and **supports overall well-being**.\n\nBy lowering stress, ashwagandha can indirectly improve **sexual health**. It promotes relaxation, reduces anxiety, and enhances mood, which are essential for a healthy libido. Incorporating ashwagandha into your daily routine can help you manage stress better and improve your sexual health.\n\n## Scientific Evidence on Ashwagandha and Sexual Desire\n\n### Research on Ashwagandha and Male Sexual Health\n\nSeveral studies have explored the impact of ashwagandha on male sexual health, focusing on [testosterone levels](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/testosterone#testosterone-levels-by-age-group), sperm quality, and fertility. The NCBI-published [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6750292/) found that men who took ashwagandha experienced a significant increase in testosterone levels, which is crucial for maintaining libido and sexual performance.\n\nAnother study from [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23796876/) showed that ashwagandha supplementation improved sperm quality, including sperm count and motility, making it beneficial for men facing fertility issues.Â Ashwagandha can enhance libido and sexual performance.\n\n### Research on Ashwagandha and Female Sexual Health\n\nResearch published by [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4609357/) on ashwagandha's effects on female sexual health has also shown promising results. Studies indicate that **ashwagandha can help balance hormones**, which is essential for maintaining a healthy libido.\n\nWomen experiencing hormonal imbalances, such as those caused by [**menopause**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/about-menopause) or [**polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/pcos-overview), may find relief with ashwagandha. [Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8985838/) suggests that it balances hormones and reduces stress, improves [insulin](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/insulin) sensitivity, and lowers blood sugar levels, which can improve reproductive health and overall well-being in women\n\nResearchGate [publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282644143_Clinical_Study_Efficacy_and_Safety_of_Ashwagandha_Withania_somnifera_Root_Extract_in_Improving_Sexual_Function_in_Women_A_Pilot_Study) reveals that women who took ashwagandha reported improvements in sexual satisfaction, including increased **arousal** and **lubrication**. The herb's stress-reducing properties also contribute to its positive effects on sexual health, as **lower stress** levels can enhance sexual desire and performance.\n\n## Benefits of Ashwagandha for Sexual Health\n\n### Benefits for Men\n\nAshwagandha offers several benefits for men's sexual health, including:\n\n- **Enhanced Testosterone Levels**: Increased testosterone can lead to improved libido and sexual performance.\n- **Improved Sperm Quality and Fertility**: Increases sperm count and motility, making it valuable for boosting reproductive health.\n- **Potential Reduction in Erectile Dysfunction Symptoms**: Some men report improvements in ED symptoms, although evidence is mixed and limited.\n\n### Benefits for Women\n\nFor women, ashwagandha can provide several sexual health benefits:\n\n- **Hormonal Balance**: Helps balance hormones and reduce symptoms associated with [menopause](https://docus.ai/tags/menopause) and [PCOS](https://docus.ai/tags/pcos).
