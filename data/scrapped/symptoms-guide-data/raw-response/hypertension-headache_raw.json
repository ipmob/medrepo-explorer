However, during a **hypertensive crisis** (blood pressure of 180/120 mm Hg or higher), a headache can occur.\n\nIt may also happen in people with newly diagnosed hypertension, even when blood pressure readings are moderately elevated, such as 140/80 mm Hg.\n\n## Why Does High Blood Pressure Cause Headaches?\n\nWhen blood pressure rises sharply, it stresses the blood vessels in your brain. This extra strain can cause pain.\n\nBut not all headaches in people with high blood pressure are directly caused by the condition. High blood pressure can indirectly contribute to headaches. Other factors can play a role, such as:\n\n- **Medication Side Effects**: Some blood pressure medications, like [calcium channel blockers](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/in-depth/calcium-channel-blockers/art-20047605#:~:text=Calcium%20channel%20blockers%20are%20medicines,arteries%20to%20squeeze%20more%20strongly.), can cause headaches as a side effect. Doctor may recommend to change the medication.\n- [**Obstructive Sleep Apnea**](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obstructive-sleep-apnea/symptoms-causes/syc-20352090#:~:text=Obstructive%20sleep%20apnea%20occurs%20when,breathing%20is%20momentarily%20cut%20off.) **(OSA)**: OSA interrupts breathing during sleep, reducing oxygen levels and causing blood pressure spikes. This can also lead to morning headaches. Treating OSA can help reduce these headaches.\n- **Stress and Anxiety**: Stress can raise blood pressure temporarily. This spike may trigger tension headaches or worsen existing ones.\n\nRecognizing these triggers can help identify what’s causing your headache. It’s not always just high blood pressure.\n\n## What Does a High Blood Pressure Headache Feel Like?\n\nThis type of headache has distinct characteristics. Here’s what to expect:\n\n- **Throbbing or pulsating pain** that may feel like a heartbeat in your head.\n- **Pressure-like sensations**, often felt behind the eyes or in the temples.\n- Pain that may worsen during physical activity or with stress.\n\nA **hypertension headache** can occur in various parts of the head, including the back of the head, but its location can vary from person to person.\n\nUnlike regular headaches, these symptoms often come with other signs of high blood pressure, such as dizziness, shortness of breath, blurry vision, or [flashing lights in the eyes](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/high-blood-pressure-flashing-lights).\n\n**Note:** _Always check your blood pressure, even if you don’t have a history of hypertension. High blood pressure can develop silently, without noticeable symptoms._\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Your Personal AI Doctor\n\nCustomize your AI Doctor to ask any health-related questions.

Here’s a comparison:\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Type**<br>**of Headache** | **Pain**<br>**Description** | **Additional**<br>**Symptoms** |\n| **Hypertension**<br>**Headache** | Throbbing<br> Pressure-like pain | Dizziness<br> Nausea<br> Blurry vision |\n| **Tension**<br>**Headache** | Tight band-like<br> pressure | Muscle tension<br> Fatigue |\n| **Migraine** | Pulsating<br> often on one side | Nausea<br> Sensitivity<br> to light or sound |\n\n## What Happens If You Ignore a Hypertension Headache?\n\nA **headache from high blood pressure** isn’t just uncomfortable—it can be dangerous. Ignoring it can lead to severe complications, such as:\n\n- **Stroke**: Extremely high blood pressure can rupture or block brain blood vessels.\n- **Heart Attack**: Prolonged high pressure puts stress on the heart.\n- **Organ Damage**: Kidneys and other organs may be affected if hypertension persists.\n\nThese risks highlight the importance of addressing hypertension headaches promptly.\n\n## How To Prevent Hypertension Headaches?\n\nPrevention focuses on controlling blood pressure. Try these practical tips:\n\n- **Eat a heart-healthy diet**: Reduce salt and increase potassium by eating fruits and vegetables.\n- **Exercise regularly**: Aim for 30 minutes of moderate activity most days of the week.\n- **Manage stress**: Practice relaxation techniques like yoga or deep breathing.\n- **Monitor your blood pressure**: Keep track of readings at home and report concerns to your doctor.\n- **Take your medications on time**: Adhere to your prescribed schedule to maintain stable blood pressure levels.\n\nSmall, consistent changes can significantly reduce your risk.\n\n## What To Do During a Hypertension Headache?\n\nIf you suspect you’re experiencing a hypertension headache, act quickly. Start by **checking your blood pressure** with a home monitor to confirm elevated readings. A hypertensive **crisis** requires **immediate medical attention**.\n\nFind a quiet place to rest and try to relax. **Reducing stress** can help prevent symptoms from worsening.\n\nIf your doctor has prescribed emergency medication, take it as directed. Avoid over-the-counter medications without medical advice, as some can raise blood pressure further.\n\nPrompt action can prevent serious complications like stroke or organ damage.\n\n## How To Manage High Blood Pressure Long-Term?\n\nEffective long-term management reduces the chances of recurrent headaches. Consider these strategies:\n\n- **Develop a treatment plan**: Work with your doctor to find the right balance of diet, exercise, and possibly medication.\n- **Stay consistent**: Adherence to healthy habits is key to lowering blood pressure over time.\n- **Track your progress**: Use tools like a blood pressure diary or apps to monitor trends.\n\n**Remember**: Managing high blood pressure improves overall health and significantly lowers the risk of complications.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Can high blood pressure cause headaches without other symptoms?\n\nYes, but it’s less common. Hypertension headaches often come with additional signs like dizziness or nausea.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Are hypertension headaches more likely in older adults?\n\nHigh blood pressure is more common with age, so the risk of these headaches increases.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# How long does a high blood pressure headache last?\n\nThe duration varies, but they often persist until blood pressure is controlled.\n\nHave more questions?

It often includes throbbing pain, dizziness, and blurry vision.\n\nPrevent these headaches by controlling your blood pressure with a healthy diet, exercise, and stress management.
