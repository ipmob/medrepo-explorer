They often appear on the soft tissues such as the inside of the lips, cheeks, or gums. Unlike cold sores, canker sores are not contagious and do not appear on the lips' exterior. These ulcers can make eating, talking, and maintaining oral hygiene uncomfortable.\n\n![Canker sores](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2F277c4524db4632ecc1b34c3548b4af31.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n### Types\n\nCanker sores come in three main types, each varying in size, number, and severity:\n\n- **Minor Canker Sores**: These are the most common type. They are small, usually just a few millimeters in size, and typically heal on their own within one to two weeks. Minor canker sores are often round or oval with a red edge.\n- **Major Canker Sores**: Less common than minor ones, major canker sores are larger and deeper. They can be more painful and take longer to heal, sometimes up to six weeks. These sores can leave scars.\n- **Herpetiform Canker Sores**: This type is rare and consists of clusters of tiny ulcers, often numbering 10 to 100. Despite their name, herpetiform canker sores are not caused by the herpes virus. They can merge to form a large, irregularly shaped sore and usually heal within two weeks without scarring.\n\n### Causes\n\nAccording to the Cleveland Clinic [publication](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/10945-canker-sores), the exact cause of canker sores remains unclear, but several factors are known to trigger their development:\n\n- **Stress**: Emotional stress is a significant trigger for many people. Stress can weaken the immune system, making it easier for canker sores to develop.\n- **Minor Injuries**: Simple injuries like accidentally biting the inside of your cheek, brushing too hard, or irritation from dental work can lead to canker sores.\n- **Vitamin Deficiencies**: A lack of certain vitamins and minerals, particularly [B12](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/vitamin-b12), [zinc](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/zinc), [iron](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/iron), and folic acid, can increase the likelihood of developing canker sores.\n- **Acidic Foods**: Eating foods high in acidity, such as citrus fruits and tomatoes, can trigger or worsen canker sores.\n- **Hormonal Changes**: Hormonal fluctuations, particularly in women, can contribute to the development of canker sores.\n- **Autoimmune Disorders**: Conditions that affect the immune system, such as lupus or inflammatory bowel diseases, can cause recurrent canker sores.\n- **Medications**: Some medications, particularly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and beta-blockers, can contribute to canker sore development.\n\n### Symptoms and Appearance\n\n- **Round or Oval Ulcers**: Typically white or yellow with a red border.\n- **Burning or Tingling Sensation**: Often felt before the sore appears.\n- **Swelling**: The area around the sore may be swollen.\n- **Pain**: The primary symptom, which can be intense, especially when eating or talking.\n\nIf you’re unsure about your symptoms, consider using an online tool like the [Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker) to identify potential health issues, but remember, always consult a professional for medical advice.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Docus AI Symptom Checker\n\nJust 3 simple steps to efficiently understand and manage your health symptoms online.\n\n[Try Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker)\n\n## Immediate Relief: OTC Treatments\n\n- **Topical Anesthetics**: Products containing lidocaine are commonly used to numb the sore area, providing temporary pain relief. Applying these products directly to the sore can help reduce discomfort, making it easier to eat and talk.\n- **Corticosteroids**: These are used to reduce inflammation and pain. Corticosteroid gels or ointments can be applied directly to the sore to decrease swelling and speed up the healing process.\n- **NSAIDs**: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can be used for pain relief. They reduce inflammation and provide temporary relief from canker sore discomfort. However, it's essential to follow the usage instructions carefully to avoid potential side effects.\n- **Mouthwashes**: Specific mouthwashes designed for canker sores can help with pain relief and healing. These often contain ingredients that soothe the sore, reduce inflammation, and prevent infection. Look for mouthwashes that do not contain alcohol, as alcohol can irritate the sore.\n\n## Home Remedies for Quick Relief\n\n### 1\\. Saltwater Rinse\n\nA saltwater rinse is a simple and effective home remedy for canker sores. It helps **reduce inflammation** and bacteria in the mouth, promoting faster healing.\n\nThe saltwater rinse can be a bit uncomfortable due to its stinging effect, but it’s effective in cleaning the sore and reducing swelling.\n\n### 2\\.

Use topical anesthetics to numb the area, and apply anti-inflammatory treatments like corticosteroids or NSAIDs to reduce swelling.
