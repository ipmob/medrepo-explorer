While they usually don't require treatment, dental intervention may be needed if the cyst becomes infected or delays tooth eruption.\n\nUnderstanding eruption cysts and maintaining regular dental check-ups are crucial for managing this condition effectively.\n\n![Eruption Cyst](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2F02e7ffcc0b88aafb74576f3ad409ca94.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\nContents\n\n- [What Is an Eruption Cyst?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/eruption-cyst#what-is-an-eruption-cyst)\n- [Symptoms of Eruption Cysts](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/eruption-cyst#symptoms-of-eruption-cysts)\n- [Causes of Eruption Cysts](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/eruption-cyst#causes-of-eruption-cysts)\n- [Treatment of Eruption Cysts](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/eruption-cyst#treatment-of-eruption-cysts)\n- [Key Takeaways](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/eruption-cyst#key-takeaways)\n\n## What Is an Eruption Cyst?\n\nAn eruption cyst is a **fluid-filled sac** that forms in the [gum tissue](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/gum-cyst) above a tooth that is about to emerge. It occurs when fluid accumulates between the crown of an erupting tooth (the part of the tooth that will be visible once it breaks through the gums) and the surrounding dental follicle.\n\nEruption cysts are harmless and usually resolve on their own as the tooth erupts.\n\n### Common Locations\n\nEruption cysts can form over any erupting tooth but are more common with **primary** (baby) teeth. They often appear over the **molars**, especially the **lower ones**, due to the larger size and pressure these teeth exert on the gums.\n\nHowever, they can also occur over incisors and canines.\n\n### Prevalence\n\nEruption cysts are relatively uncommon. They are more frequently observed in children between the ages of 6 and 9, as this is when the first permanent molars typically erupt.\n\nAccording to the NCBI [publication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5968165/), eruption cysts are rarely observed in newborns, as tooth eruption at this stage of a child’s life is unusual.\n\n## Symptoms of Eruption Cysts\n\nEruption cysts are **small**, **balloon-like bumps** on the gums, often **bluish**, **yellow**, **white-tinged**, or **clear**. They sit directly above the erupting tooth and are soft to the touch. These cysts are usually visible during the teething process.\n\nIf the cyst contains blood, it is called an **eruption hematoma**, which looks darker and more purplish. Both types are harmless and usually resolve on their own as the tooth erupts.\n\nEruption cysts are generally **not painful** but can cause mild discomfort or tenderness in the gums. Symptoms may include:\n\n- Mild swelling around the cyst\n- Tenderness when touched or during chewing\n- Slight gum color change around the cyst\n\nTypically, these symptoms are minor. If there is significant discomfort, bleeding, or signs of infection, consult a dentist.\n\nFor more guidance on managing your child's symptoms, use the [Symptom Checker for Kids](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker/child-symptom-checker) to identify health concerns and seek appropriate care, but remember, online tools are not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Docus AI Symptom Checker\n\nJust 3 simple steps to efficiently understand and manage your health symptoms online.\n\n[Try Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker)\n\n## Causes of Eruption Cysts\n\nEruption cysts form when fluid accumulates between the crown of an erupting tooth and the surrounding dental follicle, creating a small, balloon-like sac in the gum tissue. This sac cushions the emerging tooth as it pushes through the gums.\n\nThe exact cause of eruption cysts is not always clear, but several factors can contribute to their formation:\n\n- **Inflammation**: Swelling and inflammation in the gums can lead to fluid accumulation around the erupting tooth.\n- **Trauma**: Injury to the gums from teething toys or other objects can trigger cyst formation.\n- **Irritation**: Continuous irritation from chewing or biting can cause fluid build-up in the gum tissue.\n- **Infection**: Bacterial infections in the gums may lead to the development of cysts.\n- **Overcrowding**: When teeth are closely packed, there may be less space for them to emerge, increasing the likelihood of cyst formation.\n- **Dental Decay**: Cavities and decay in primary teeth can sometimes contribute to the development of eruption cysts.\n\n## Treatment of Eruption Cysts\n\n### Self-Resolution\n\nMost eruption cysts **resolve on their own without any intervention**. As the tooth continues to push through the gums, the cyst typically bursts naturally, releasing the fluid and allowing the tooth to emerge.\n\nThis process usually occurs within a few days to weeks, depending on the tooth's growth rate. Parents should monitor the cyst for signs of resolution and maintain good oral hygiene to support the process.\n\n### Dental Intervention\n\nIn some cases, a **dentist may need to intervene**, particularly if:\n\n- The cyst does not rupture on its own.\n- There are signs of infection, such as pus or severe swelling.\n- The eruption of the tooth is delayed significantly.\n- The child experiences considerable discomfort.\n\n**Common procedures** for treating persistent eruption cysts include:\n\n- **Unroofing**: The dentist makes a small incision in the cyst to drain the fluid and relieve pressure, facilitating the tooth's eruption.\n- **Minor Surgical Interventions**: In rare cases, more extensive surgical procedures may be necessary to remove dense or fibrous tissue blocking the tooth's path.\n\n### Post-Treatment Care\n\nAfter treatment, it is essential to follow proper aftercare guidelines to ensure healing and prevent complications:\n\n- **Oral Hygiene**: Encourage gentle brushing and flossing to keep the area clean.\n- **Pain Management**: Use over-the-counter pain relievers as recommended by the dentist to manage discomfort.\n- **Monitoring**: Keep an eye on the treated area for signs of infection or recurrence.\n- **Regular Check-Ups**: Schedule follow-up visits with the dentist to monitor the tooth's eruption and overall oral health.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What is an eruption cyst in a baby?\n\nAn eruption cyst in a baby is a fluid-filled sac that forms in the gum tissue above a tooth that is about to emerge. These cysts can appear bluish, yellow, white-tinged, or clear and typically resolve on their own as the tooth pushes through the gum.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# How is an eruption cyst treated?\n\nMost eruption cysts do not require treatment and will resolve on their own as the tooth emerges. However, if the cyst becomes infected, causes significant discomfort, or delays the tooth's eruption, a dentist may need to intervene by draining the cyst or performing a minor surgical procedure.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What should I do if my baby has an eruption cyst on a molar?\n\nIf your baby has an eruption cyst on a molar, monitor the cyst for signs of natural resolution. Ensure good oral hygiene and maintain regular dental check-ups. If the cyst causes significant discomfort, shows signs of infection, or does not resolve within a reasonable time, consult a dentist for further evaluation and possible treatment.\n\nHave more questions?
