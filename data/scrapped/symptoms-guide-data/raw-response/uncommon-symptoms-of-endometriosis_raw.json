Managing these symptoms is crucial for improving quality of life and avoiding misdiagnosis.\n\n![uncommon symptoms of endometriosis](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2Faa80b022f32d217cae337bc8a387bbbc.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\nContents\n\n- [What is Endometriosis?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/uncommon-symptoms-of-endometriosis#what-is-endometriosis)\n- [Common Symptoms of Endometriosis](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/uncommon-symptoms-of-endometriosis#common-symptoms-of-endometriosis)\n- [Uncommon Symptoms of Endometriosis](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/uncommon-symptoms-of-endometriosis#uncommon-symptoms-of-endometriosis)\n- [When to Seek Medical Advice](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/uncommon-symptoms-of-endometriosis#when-to-seek-medical-advice)\n- [Key Takeaways](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/uncommon-symptoms-of-endometriosis#key-takeaways)\n\n## What is Endometriosis?\n\n[Endometriosis](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/endometriosis-explained) is a chronic medical condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus, known as the endometrium, grows outside the uterine cavity. This misplaced tissue continues to act as it normally would — thickening, breaking down, and bleeding with each menstrual cycle. However, because it has no way to exit the body, it becomes trapped.\n\nEndometrial-like tissue can grow on the **ovaries**, **fallopian tubes**, the outer surface of the **uterus**, and other organs within the pelvis. In rare cases, it can also spread beyond the pelvic organs. The exact cause of endometriosis is not well understood, but several theories include retrograde menstruation, immune system disorders, and genetic factors.\n\nAccording to the [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/endometriosis/?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw7ZO0BhDYARIsAFttkCjrhuiET-ahOeSkEb6SzV5EoUR9GvPCj0bw1ydVUJXfcAu_C1K2RcMaAiaQEALw_wcB), endometriosis affects approximately **10%** of women of reproductive age globally. This translates to about **190 million** women worldwide. The condition is most commonly diagnosed in women in their **30s** and 40s, but it can affect any woman who menstruates, including teenagers.\n\n## Common Symptoms of Endometriosis\n\n- **[Pelvic Pain](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/stabbing-pain-in-pelvic-area-in-females)**: Chronic and often debilitating pain in the pelvic region, particularly before and during menstruation.\n- **[Painful Periods (Dysmenorrhea)](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/8-types-of-abnormal-menstruation)**: Severe menstrual cramps that can start before the period and last several days, often accompanied by heavy bleeding or spotting.\n- **Infertility**: Difficulty in conceiving due to scarring and adhesions that distort the pelvic anatomy, obstructing the fallopian tubes and affecting ovarian and uterine function.\n- **Heavy Menstrual Bleeding (Menorrhagia)**: Excessive menstrual bleeding that can lead to anemia and severe fatigue.\n- **Pain During Intercourse (Dyspareunia)**: Pain experienced during or after sexual activity, often due to endometrial-like tissue located behind the uterus or in the lower pelvic cavity.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Docus AI Symptom Checker\n\nJust 3 simple steps to efficiently understand and manage your health symptoms online.\n\n[Try Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker)\n\n## Uncommon Symptoms of Endometriosis\n\n### 1\\. Chronic Fatigue\n\nEndometriosis can lead to chronic [fatigue](https://docus.ai/tags/fatigue) due to systemic inflammation and hormonal imbalances. The inflammatory response associated with endometriosis can affect the entire body, leading to persistent tiredness. Hormonal fluctuations, particularly involving [estrogen](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/estrogen), can also disrupt normal energy levels and contribute to fatigue.\n\n#### Associated Issues\n\nChronic fatigue in endometriosis patients is often compounded by **insomnia**, **depression**, and **occupational stress**. These conditions can create a vicious cycle, where pain and sleep disturbances exacerbate fatigue, and fatigue contributes to a decline in mental health and work performance.\n\n#### Research Reference\n\nA 2018 [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7277433/) from IJERPH indicated that a significant majority of women with endometriosis experience recurrent fatigue. This fatigue is often linked with pain, insomnia, depression, and occupational stress, showing that the condition's impact extends beyond physical symptoms to affect overall well-being.\n\n### 2\\. Pain Outside the Pelvic Region\n\nEndometriosis can cause pain in areas beyond the pelvis, including the **shoulders**, **chest**, and **lower back**. This is often due to the spread of endometrial-like tissue to these regions.\n\n#### Neuropathic Pain\n\nNeuropathic pain in endometriosis patients arises from nerve damage or dysfunction caused by **endometrial lesions**. This type of pain is characterized by tingling, burning, or shooting sensations and can significantly impact quality of life.\n\n#### Case Study\n\nFor instance, a 2017 GMT [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6113996/) documented cases of endometriosis affecting the sciatic nerve, resulting in [sciatica](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/sciatica-overview)-like symptoms. Patients experienced significant nerve pain that correlated with their menstrual cycles, illustrating how endometriosis can extend beyond traditional symptoms.\n\n### 3\\. Urinary Changes\n\n#### Common Symptoms\n\nWomen with endometriosis often report **frequent urination**, **pain during urination**, a s **udden urge to urinate**, and **blood in the urine**. These symptoms typically worsen during menstruation.\n\n#### Overlap with Other Conditions\n\nThese urinary symptoms can mimic those of other urinary tract conditions, such as urinary tract infections or interstitial cystitis, making diagnosis challenging.\n\n#### Research Findings\n\nAccording to a [2022 study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358257243_Association_between_endometriosis_and_lower_urinary_tract_symptoms) published in Fertility and Sterility, individuals with endometriosis report lower urinary tract symptoms significantly more often than those without the condition.\n\nThe study, conducted through a cross-sectional analysis of **1,161 women**, found that those with endometriosis had a significantly **higher prevalence of various LUTSs**, including difficulty passing urine, feeling full after urination, frequent urination, dysuria, and bladder pain.\n\n### 4\\. Gastrointestinal Issues\n\n#### Symptoms\n\nGastrointestinal symptoms in endometriosis patients can include diarrhea, constipation, bloating, and nausea. These symptoms can be particularly severe during menstruation.\n\n#### Impact\n\nThese gastrointestinal issues can be easily mistaken for other conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Misdiagnosis can lead to inappropriate treatment and prolonged suffering.\n\n#### Case Study\n\nAccording to a study [published in BMC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4535676/) Women's Health, up to **90% of endometriosis patients experience gastrointestinal symptoms**, significantly impacting their quality of life. It shows that women with endometriosis are at a three to five times greater risk of developing IBS compared to healthy women, with IBS rates as high as **52%** among those with endometriosis.\n\n### 5\\. Severe Acne\n\nThere is a potential connection between severe teenage [acne](https://docus.ai/tags/acne) and a higher risk of developing endometriosis. Hormonal imbalances that cause severe acne may also play a role in the development of endometriosis.\n\n#### Early Indicator\n\nSevere acne, particularly during adolescence, could serve as an early indicator of endometriosis, prompting further investigation and early intervention.\n\n#### Supporting Research\n\nA 2014 study published in [Oxford Academic](https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/29/11/2592/2426834) found that women who experienced severe acne during their teenage years were more likely to develop endometriosis, suggesting a link between hormonal activity and the condition.\n\n### 6\\. Headaches and Migraines\n\nHormonal fluctuations associated with endometriosis can lead to headaches and migraines. These headaches often coincide with menstrual cycles and can be debilitating.\n\n#### Symptoms\n\nThe [headaches](https://docus.ai/tags/headache) experienced by endometriosis patients can differ from regular **migraines**, often being more severe and frequent due to the constant hormonal changes and chronic pain associated with the condition.\n\n#### Research Insight\n\n[Research](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2021.814474/full) by Frontiers in Endocrinology reveals that **women with endometriosis experience migraines more frequently than those without the condition**, with a higher likelihood of severe endometriosis among those who suffer from migraines. Additionally, the frequency of migraines increases in cases where endometriosis is accompanied by adenomyosis.\n\n### 7\\. Mental and Emotional Health Issues\n\nChronic pain and the various symptoms of endometriosis can lead to significant mental health challenges, including [**anxiety**](https://docus.ai/tags/anxiety), **depression**, and [**stress**](https://docus.ai/tags/stress). The ongoing struggle with pain and uncertainty can be mentally exhausting.\n\n#### Quality of Life\n\nThese mental health issues can severely affect daily functioning and overall quality of life. The stress of managing a chronic condition, coupled with the physical symptoms, can lead to a **decline in mental well-being**.\n\n#### Supporting Research\n\n“ _The relationship between endometriosis and mental health is more complicated than we expected_” [notes](https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/women-with-endometriosis-also-genetically-predisposed-to-depression-anxiety-and-eating-disorders/) Renato Polimanti, PhD, associate professor of psychiatry and the principal investigator of the study at Yale School of Medicine.\n\nAccording to the Gynecologic and Obstetric Investigation [research](https://karger.com/goi/article-abstract/86/4/315/819990/Does-Endometriosis-Disturb-Mental-Health-and), women with endometriosis are more likely to experience mental health issues compared to those without the condition. Endometriosis may significantly increase the risk of depression and anxiety, negatively affecting both mental and physical HRQoL.\n\nIf you are unsure about your endometriosis symptoms, use the [Docus Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker/symptom-checker-for-women/endometriosis) as an initial step to identifying your condition, However, it is not a replacement for a real doctor, and consulting a healthcare professional is essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment.\n\n## When to Seek Medical Advice\n\n- Chronic pelvic pain\n- Severe menstrual cramps that do not improve with over-the-counter pain medication\n- Gastrointestinal issues such as persistent diarrhea, constipation, bloating, or nausea\n- Urinary changes like frequent urination, pain during urination, or blood in the urine\n- Persistent fatigue that affects your daily activities\n- Pain during intercourse\n- Severe headaches or migraines\n- Mental health issues such as anxiety or depression related to chronic pain\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What are some uncommon symptoms of endometriosis?\n\nUncommon symptoms of endometriosis can include gastrointestinal issues, chronic fatigue, headaches and migraines, urinary changes, and pain outside the pelvic region.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Can endometriosis cause gastrointestinal problems?\n\nYes, endometriosis can lead to gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, constipation, bloating, and nausea, which can often be mistaken for other digestive disorders.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Is chronic fatigue a symptom of endometriosis?\n\nChronic fatigue is a significant but lesser-known symptom of endometriosis.
