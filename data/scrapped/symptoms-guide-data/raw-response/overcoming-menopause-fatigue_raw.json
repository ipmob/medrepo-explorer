This fatigue arises from hormonal changes, particularly the decrease in estrogen and progesterone, which disrupt energy levels and sleep patterns.\n\n![menopause fatigue](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2F1d4698859c08a6549ae4a6f87526199e.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\nContents\n\n- [What is Menopause Fatigue?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/overcoming-menopause-fatigue#what-is-menopause-fatigue)\n- [Why Does Menopause Cause Fatigue?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/overcoming-menopause-fatigue#why-does-menopause-cause-fatigue)\n- [Recognizing Menopause Fatigue: Symptoms to Watch For](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/overcoming-menopause-fatigue#recognizing-menopause-fatigue-symptoms-to-watch-for)\n- [Guide to Managing Menopause Fatigue](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/overcoming-menopause-fatigue#guide-to-managing-menopause-fatigue)\n- [Key Takeaways](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/overcoming-menopause-fatigue#key-takeaways)\n\n## What is Menopause Fatigue?\n\n[Menopause fatigue](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/menopause-fatigue) is a prevalent concern among women undergoing [menopause](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/about-menopause). Defined as an overwhelming sense of tiredness that isn't alleviated by rest, menopause fatigue can significantly impact daily activities and quality of life. It differs from ordinary fatigue in that it often co-occurs with hormonal changes characteristic of menopause, making it both more persistent and severe.\n\nRemarkably, a study involving 300 women revealed that a staggering **85.3%** of those in postmenopause reported experiencing mental or physical tiredness, as the NCBI [publication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5866170/) states.\n\n## Why Does Menopause Cause Fatigue?\n\nMenopause [fatigue](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/sudden-crashing-fatigue-in-females) is deeply rooted in the hormonal changes a woman undergoes during this transitional phase. To understand why menopause causes fatigue, it's crucial to consider the role of hormones like **estrogen** and **progesterone**. These hormones do more than regulate menstruation; they also influence **energy levels**, **mood**, and overall **vitality**.\n\nAs women enter [perimenopause](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/perimenopause), the production of [estrogen](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/estrogen) and [progesterone](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/progesterone) by the ovaries begins to fluctuate and eventually decrease. This decline disrupts the body's normal **metabolic processes**, leading to decreased **energy production** and **increased fatigue**. Additionally, these hormonal changes can affect sleep quality, further compounding feelings of tiredness and lethargy.\n\n## Recognizing Menopause Fatigue: Symptoms to Watch For\n\nIdentifying menopause fatigue can be challenging as it often mirrors the tiredness felt from life's general stresses. However, certain symptoms are particularly indicative of menopause-related fatigue:\n\n- **Persistent tiredness**: Feeling exhausted despite getting a full night's sleep.\n- **Lack of energ** y: Struggling to perform daily tasks that were once routine.\n- **Reduced mental focus**: Difficulty concentrating or remembering things.\n- **Emotional changes**: Increased irritability or mood swings without a clear cause.\n- **Physical exhaustion**: Simple activities like climbing stairs or walking short distances feel more strenuous.\n\nFor a more tailored approach to identifying your symptoms, visit [Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker/symptom-checker-for-women/menopause). This tool can help delineate whether the fatigue you’re experiencing aligns with menopausal changes, though it’s not a substitute for professional medical advice. Always consult with a healthcare provider for a comprehensive assessment.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Docus AI Symptom Checker\n\nJust 3 simple steps to efficiently understand and manage your health symptoms online.\n\n[Try Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker)\n\n## Guide to Managing Menopause Fatigue\n\nManaging menopause fatigue effectively involves a multi-faceted approach.
