Back pain with fever refers to the experience of discomfort or pain in any area of the back accompanied by an elevated body temperature. This combination can signal an underlying condition that may require medical attention. It's crucial to not dismiss these symptoms as they often indicate the body's response to an infection or other serious health issues.\n\nBack pain can vary from mild to severe and may be classified as [lower](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/causes-symptoms-of-lower-back-pain), middle, or [upper back pain](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/relieve-upper-back-pain-solutions-for-common-causes). The addition of a fever complicates the diagnosis and treatment, making it imperative to closely monitor the symptoms and seek medical advice promptly.\n\n### Causes of Back Pain with Fever\n\n#### Mechanical Causes\n\nMany cases of back pain stem from mechanical issues, which do not typically involve fever unless an infection is also present. Common mechanical causes include:\n\n- **Injuries**: Sudden impacts or accidents can cause immediate back pain.\n- **Prolonged Strain**: Activities that put continuous stress on the back, like heavy lifting or long periods of sitting, especially with poor posture, can lead to back pain.\n\n#### Infection-Related Causes\n\nWhen back pain is accompanied by fever, it often points to an infection. Here are some of the critical infection-related conditions:\n\n- **Spinal Epidural Abscess**: This is a rare but severe condition characterized by the accumulation of pus in the epidural space, which can compress the spinal cord. Symptoms often include severe back pain, fever, and in some cases, changes in [bowel](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/constipation-cause-back-pain) or bladder function. The most common culprits are bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus.\n- **Vertebral Osteomyelitis**: This is an infection of the vertebrae often caused by bacteria or fungi. The condition can develop after surgery or from an infection spread through the bloodstream. Symptoms include severe back pain, fever, and an overall feeling of malaise.\n- **Kidney Infections (Pyelonephritis)**: These infections usually start in the [bladder](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/bladder-infection-vs-uti#what-is-a-bladder-infection) or urethra and travel up to the kidneys, causing lower back pain and fever. A population-based study published in [Medscape](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/245559-overview?form=fpf) conducted in the United States revealed that the annual incidence of acute pyelonephritis is approximately **15-17 cases per 10,000 females** and **3-4 cases per 10,000 males**. Other symptoms might include painful urination and cloudy urine.\n\n#### Rare Causes\n\nWhile less common, there are serious conditions associated with back pain and fever that require immediate attention:\n\n- **Cancer**: Certain cancers can cause back pain when they involve the spine, such as bone metastases from prostate or breast cancer.\n- **Severe Infections**: Conditions like septicemia (blood infection) can cause widespread inflammation and fever, with back pain as a secondary symptom due to the body's overall response to infection.\n\nFor anyone experiencing these symptoms, it's important to use tools like the [Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker/symptom-checker-for-adults/back-pain) for an initial assessment, but always follow up with a healthcare professional to obtain a definitive diagnosis and appropriate treatment.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Docus AI Symptom Checker\n\nJust 3 simple steps to efficiently understand and manage your health symptoms online.\n\n[Try Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker)\n\n## Symptoms That Should Not Be Ignored\n\nWhen dealing with back pain and fever, certain symptoms should prompt immediate medical attention. Identifying these warning signs early can be crucial for effective treatment and preventing complications:\n\n- Severe or escalating back pain that does not improve with rest\n- [Fever](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/when-to-go-to-the-hospital-for-fever) over 101°F (38.3°C) that persists or recurs\n- Sudden weakness, [tingling](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/fingertips-tingling), or numbness in the [legs](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/tingling-in-lower-legs) or arms\n- Loss of bladder or bowel control\n- Unexplained weight loss\n- Intense stiffness that restricts movement, especially if it inhibits bending, [walking](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/lower-back-pain-when-walking-treatment-and-prevention-tips), or twisting\n- Pain that radiates down one or both legs\n- Severe [abdominal pain](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/understanding-causes-of-lower-abdomen-pain)\n- Signs of infection, including redness or swelling on the back\n- Night sweats or chills\n\n## Diagnosis and Treatment Options\n\n### Diagnostic Techniques\n\nAccurate diagnosis is essential for treating back pain with fever effectively. Medical professionals rely on several diagnostic techniques to understand the underlying causes:\n\n- **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)**: This imaging technique is particularly useful for viewing soft tissues, including discs, muscles, and spinal cord.\n- **CT Scans**: Provides a more detailed look at the vertebral structure of the spine, which can help detect abnormalities or infections.\n- **X-rays**: Although less detailed for soft tissue, X-rays are useful for identifying fractures or structural abnormalities.\n- [**Blood Tests**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview): Can detect markers of infection or inflammation that may indicate an infection or other underlying conditions.\n- [**Urine Tests**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/urinalysis-test): Important for diagnosing kidney infections, which could be the source of back pain and fever.\n\n### Treatment Modalities\n\nTreatment for back pain and fever varies based on the underlying cause but generally includes:\n\n#### Medical Treatments\n\n- Antibiotics are often prescribed if an infection is identified.\n- Pain relievers and anti-inflammatory medications to manage symptoms.\n\n#### Potential Surgeries\n\n- In cases of severe infections like spinal epidural abscess, surgery may be necessary to drain the abscess and relieve pressure on the spinal cord.\n\n#### Home Care Tips\n\n- Rest is crucial to avoid aggravating the condition.\n- Heat and cold therapy can help relieve pain and inflammation.\n- Gentle exercises, as recommended by a healthcare provider, can aid in recovery.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What should I do if I experience lower back pain with a fever?\n\nIf you experience lower back pain accompanied by a fever, it's important to monitor the symptoms closely. Should the fever persist or the pain intensify, consult a healthcare provider immediately as these symptoms could indicate an underlying infection or another serious condition.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# How can fever and lower back pain be related?\n\nFever and lower back pain together often suggest an infection in the lower spine, such as a spinal epidural abscess or kidney infection. These conditions require medical evaluation and treatment.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Are there specific concerns associated with fever and general back pain?\n\nYes, fever combined with back pain could be a sign of an infection affecting the spine, such as vertebral osteomyelitis, or a more systemic condition like an infection that has spread from another part of the body. It's crucial to identify the infection source and treat it promptly.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What causes upper back pain with fever?\n\nUpper back pain with fever may indicate a serious infection such as meningitis, especially if it is accompanied by other symptoms like stiffness in the neck, headache, and sensitivity to light. Medical attention should be sought immediately to rule out these conditions.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What should be considered if someone has middle back pain and fever?\n\nMiddle back pain coupled with fever could point to an infection in the thoracic spine or issues with organs located near the middle back, such as the kidneys or pancreas. A healthcare provider can assess symptoms and may order imaging tests to determine the exact cause.\n\nHave more questions?
