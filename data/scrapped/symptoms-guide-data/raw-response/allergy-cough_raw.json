Identifying and treating an allergy cough is essential to improve your quality of life and prevent it from disrupting your daily activities.\n\n![allergy cough](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2F1a28b91707ef727c26a0a3e2ec6882aa.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\nContents\n\n- [What Is an Allergy Cough?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/allergy-cough#what-is-an-allergy-cough)\n- [Common Triggers of an Allergy Cough](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/allergy-cough#common-triggers-of-an-allergy-cough)\n- [Signs of an Allergic Cough](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/allergy-cough#signs-of-an-allergic-cough)\n- [Differentiating Allergy Coughs from Other Coughs](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/allergy-cough#differentiating-allergy-coughs-from-other-coughs)\n- [How to Stop Coughing from Allergies](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/allergy-cough#how-to-stop-coughing-from-allergies)\n- [Preventing Allergy: Practical Tips](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/allergy-cough#preventing-allergy-practical-tips)\n- [When to See A Doctor](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/allergy-cough#when-to-see-a-doctor)\n- [Conclusion](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/allergy-cough#conclusion)\n\n## What Is an Allergy Cough?\n\nAn allergy cough is a type of **dry**, **persistent cough** that occurs when your [body reacts to certain allergens](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/allergy-attack). Unlike a cough caused by a [cold](https://docus.ai/tags/cold) or [flu](https://docus.ai/tags/flu), which often brings up [mucus](https://docus.ai/tags/mucus), an allergy cough is **typically non-productive**, meaning it doesn't result in the expulsion of phlegm.\n\nWhen you breathe in these allergens, your immune system releases chemicals like histamine, which causes inflammation in your airways. This inflammation can lead to symptoms such as throat irritation and a tickling sensation that triggers coughing.\n\nAllergy coughs often occur alongside other allergy symptoms, such as a runny nose, itchy eyes, or sneezing, making them easy to distinguish from other types of coughs.\n\nUnlike a cold or flu-related cough, which usually resolves in a week or two, an allergy cough can **persist for weeks or even longer** as long as you are exposed to the allergen.\n\n## Common Triggers of an Allergy Cough\n\nHere are some of the primary allergens that might be causing your allergy cough:\n\n- **Pollen:** Pollen is a major trigger, especially during spring and fall. Trees, grasses, and weeds release pollen into the air, leading to symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and a persistent allergy cough, particularly during high pollen seasons.\n- **Pet Dander:** Pet dander, tiny flakes of skin from animals like cats and dogs, is another frequent cause. Based on data from the [AAIR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5809771/), approximately 10% to 20% of people worldwide are allergic to dogs and cats, including their dander. This allergen can linger in the air and on surfaces, even in homes without pets.\n- **Dust Mites:** Dust mites thrive in warm, humid environments like bedding and carpets. Inhaling dust containing these mites can trigger an allergy cough, often worsening in the morning after sleeping in mite-infested bedding.\n- **Mold:** Mold spores, common in damp, poorly ventilated areas, are a significant indoor allergen. Inhaling these spores can irritate your airways, especially in high-humidity environments, leading to a chronic allergy cough.\n\n## Signs of an Allergic Cough\n\nIdentifying the signs of an allergic cough can help you determine if your cough is due to allergies rather than another cause. An allergic cough is typically characterized by:\n\n- **Dry, Persistent Cough:** Unlike a cough from a cold or flu, an allergy cough is usually dry and non-productive, meaning it doesn't bring up mucus. The cough can persist for several weeks or longer, especially when you're exposed to allergens.\n- **Throat Irritation:** You may experience a tickling or itching sensation in the back of your throat, which often triggers the urge to cough.\n- **Postnasal Drip:** Allergies can cause mucus to drain from your sinuses into your throat, leading to a frequent need to clear your throat or a persistent cough.\n- **Sneezing and Runny Nose:** These symptoms often accompany an allergy cough, as your body reacts to allergens like pollen, dust mites, or pet dander.\n- **Itchy Eyes or Skin:** Allergic reactions often include [itching](https://docus.ai/tags/itching), particularly around the eyes, nose, or skin.\n\nRecognizing these signs can help you manage your symptoms more effectively and choose the best allergy cough treatment.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Docus AI Symptom Checker\n\nJust 3 simple steps to efficiently understand and manage your health symptoms online.\n\n[Try Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker)\n\n## Differentiating Allergy Coughs from Other Coughs\n\nAccording to the [ACAAI](https://acaai.org/allergies/symptoms/cough/), **90%** of chronic coughs are linked to one of these conditions: asthma, chronic bronchitis, gastroesophageal reflux ( [GERD](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/overview-of-gerd)), postnasal drip, or smoking.\n\nThe main signs to look out for include whether your cough is dry or productive, additional symptoms like fever or wheezing, and the duration of your cough.\n\n### Asthma\n\nAsthma-related coughs are often dry and persistent, similar to an allergy cough. However, asthma coughs are typically accompanied by **wheezing**, a **whistling sound when you breathe**, and **shortness of breath**.\n\n[Asthma](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/asthma) symptoms can worsen during physical activity, exposure to cold air, or after contact with allergens.\n\nUnlike an allergy cough, asthma may require the use of **inhalers** to manage the inflammation in the airways effectively.\n\n### Chronic Bronchitis\n\nChronic bronchitis, a form of **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease**(COPD), usually causes a **productive cough** that brings up mucus. This type of cough is persistent and is often **worse in the mornings**.\n\nAdditional symptoms include **shortness of breath** and **frequent respiratory infections**.\n\nUnlike an allergy cough, which is usually triggered by allergens, chronic bronchitis is often caused by long-term exposure to irritants, particularly smoking.\n\n### Gastroesophageal Reflux (GERD)\n\nA cough caused by **gastroesophageal reflux disease** (GERD) is typically dry and can worsen after eating or when lying down. GERD occurs when stomach acid backs up into the esophagus, irritating the throat and triggering a cough.\n\nThis type of cough is often accompanied by symptoms like **heartburn**, a **sour taste in the mouth**, or **hoarseness**.\n\nUnlike an allergy cough, GERD-related coughs are directly related to digestive issues rather than respiratory allergens.\n\n### Postnasal Drip\n\nPostnasal drip, often linked to allergies, occurs when excess mucus from the sinuses drips down the back of the throat, causing irritation and a persistent cough. This type of cough is usually dry but can sometimes bring up small amounts of mucus, especially in the morning.\n\nSymptoms include a **constant need to clear your throat**, **a tickling sensation in the throat**, and a **runny or congested nose**.\n\nWhile postnasal drip is often associated with allergies, it can also be caused by infections or irritants.\n\n### Smoking\n\nSmoking is a significant cause of chronic cough, often resulting in a productive cough that brings up phlegm, especially in the morning. This cough, commonly referred to as \" [smoker's cough](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/understanding-smokers-cough),\" is persistent and can lead to further respiratory issues over time.\n\nA [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20662762/) from Annals of Medicine found that more than **40%** of young military personnel who smoked daily and **27%** of those who smoked occasionally reported experiencing chronic cough and phlegm production.\n\nUnlike an allergy cough, which is triggered by exposure to allergens, smoking-related coughs are directly caused by the inhalation of tobacco smoke and its irritants.\n\nIf you're unsure whether your symptoms are related to allergies or another condition, Docus AI [Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker) can help you identify potential causes and guide you on the next steps to take. Remember, it's always important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Docus AI Symptom Checker\n\nJust 3 simple steps to efficiently understand and manage your health symptoms online.\n\n[Try Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker)\n\n## How to Stop Coughing from Allergies\n\nStopping a cough caused by allergies requires a combination of medical treatments and natural remedies tailored to your specific symptoms:\n\n### Medical Treatments\n\n- **Over-the-Counter Antihistamines:** Antihistamines are often the first line of defense against allergy symptoms. They work by blocking histamine, a chemical released during an allergic reaction that can cause throat irritation and coughing. Common antihistamines like those found in allergy cough medicine are available without a prescription and can help reduce coughing.\n- **Decongestants and Expectorants:** Decongestants help relieve nasal congestion by shrinking swollen blood vessels in your nasal passages, making it easier to breathe and reducing postnasal drip. Expectorants, on the other hand, thin the mucus, making it easier to cough up. This can be particularly helpful if your allergy cough has become productive.\n- **Nasal Corticosteroids:** Nasal sprays containing corticosteroids are highly effective at reducing inflammation in the nasal passages, which can help decrease postnasal drip and the resulting cough. These sprays are often used daily during allergy seasons to keep symptoms in check.\n\n### Natural Remedies\n\n- **Honey and Herbal Teas:** Honey is known for its soothing properties and can help calm a sore throat and reduce the urge to cough. Herbal teas made from ingredients like ginger, turmeric, or chamomile can also provide relief by reducing inflammation and soothing irritated airways.\n- **Steam Inhalation and Saline Nasal Rinses:** Inhaling steam can help moisten dry airways and loosen mucus, making it easier to clear your throat. Saline nasal rinses can flush out allergens and mucus from your nasal passages, reducing postnasal drip and the associated cough.\n- **Using a Humidifier and Air Purifier:** Keeping the air in your home moist with a humidifier can prevent throat irritation and dry coughs. Air purifiers can remove allergens like pollen, dust mites, and pet dander from the air, reducing your exposure to these triggers.\n\n**Note**: _Always consult with a healthcare provider to determine the best allergy cough treatment for you._\n\n## Preventing Allergy: Practical Tips\n\nPrevention is key to managing an allergy cough, and there are several practical steps you can take to minimize exposure to allergens and reduce the likelihood of symptoms:\n\n- **Allergy-Proof Your Home:** Keep your living space as allergen-free as possible by regularly cleaning and vacuuming with a HEPA filter. Wash your bedding in hot water weekly, and consider using allergen-proof covers on pillows and mattresses to prevent dust mites from settling in.\n- **Manage Outdoor Exposure:** During high pollen seasons, try to stay indoors, especially in the morning when pollen levels are highest. If you need to go outside, wearing sunglasses can help keep pollen out of your eyes. When you return home, change your clothes and shower to remove any allergens that may have settled on your skin and hair.\n- **Dietary Tips and Supplements:** Some studies suggest that a diet rich in anti-inflammatory foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and omega-3 fatty acids, may help reduce allergy symptoms. Supplements like quercetin, a natural antihistamine found in many fruits and vegetables, might also offer relief. However, it’s important to talk to your healthcare provider before starting any new supplements.\n\n## When to See A Doctor\n\nWhile an allergy cough is often manageable with home treatments, there are times when it’s important to seek medical help. You should consult a healthcare provider if:\n\n- **Cough Persists Beyond 8 Weeks:** A cough that lasts for more than two months could indicate a more serious condition and should be evaluated by a doctor.\n- **Presence of Severe Symptoms:** If your cough is accompanied by wheezing, shortness of breath, or chest tightness, it may be a sign of asthma or another respiratory condition that requires medical attention.\n- **No Improvement with Treatment:** If over-the-counter medications and natural remedies do not alleviate your symptoms, it may be time to see an allergist. They can perform specialized tests to determine the exact cause of your symptoms and recommend a targeted treatment plan.\n\nDon’t hesitate to consult a healthcare provider if your allergy cough is affecting your quality of life. A professional can help you find the best solution to stop coughing from allergies and improve your overall well-being.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What is the best medicine for an allergy cough?\n\nThe best medicine for an allergy cough often includes over-the-counter antihistamines, which help reduce the body's reaction to allergens.
