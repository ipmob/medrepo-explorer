These hormonal surges are essential for maintaining the pregnancy, but they can also lead to the stomach upset commonly referred to as morning sickness, which for many can occur at any time of the day.\n\nWhile most women experience relief from nausea as they move past the first trimester, for some, these symptoms may persist or return later.\n\n### Unique Third Trimester Causes\n\nAs the baby grows, several physical and hormonal changes specific to the third trimester can exacerbate or trigger nausea:\n\n- **Hormonal Fluctuations**: Although the intense increase in certain hormones stabilizes, the continual adjustments can still provoke nausea.\n- **Physical Pressure**: The expanding uterus puts additional pressure on a mother’s stomach and intestines, which can disrupt normal digestion and cause discomfort.\n- **Medical Conditions**: Conditions like preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome are serious and can emerge in the third trimester. Both conditions can exacerbate nausea due to the stress they place on the body’s systems.\n\nUnderstanding these triggers is crucial for managing this uncomfortable symptom and ensuring both mother and baby’s health.\n\n## How to Manage and Treat Third Trimester Nausea\n\nManaging nausea in the third trimester involves a combination of dietary adjustments, home remedies, and medical interventions. Each strategy can play a vital role in alleviating symptoms.\n\n### Diet and Lifestyle Adjustments\n\nWhat you eat and how you manage your lifestyle can significantly impact nausea:\n\n- **Eat Small, Frequent Meals**: Keeping the stomach slightly but not overly full can prevent nausea. Large meals can overburden the digestive system, making symptoms worse.\n- **Avoid Trigger Foods**: Spicy, fatty, and highly acidic foods can aggravate nausea. Identifying and avoiding these can help maintain comfort.\n- **Stay Hydrated**: Small sips of water throughout the day can aid digestion and reduce nausea triggers.\n\n### Home Remedies\n\nSeveral [natural remedies](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/remedies-and-foods-to-help-with-nausea) can be effective in managing nausea:\n\n- **Ginger**: This root has antiemetic properties that can soothe the stomach. Ginger tea or ginger chews are popular choices.\n- **Peppermint**: Peppermint tea or sucking on peppermint candies can help settle the stomach.\n- **Acupressure**: Acupressure bands, worn on the wrist, can reduce nausea by stimulating pressure points.\n\nPractical Tips:\n\n- Incorporate ginger into your daily diet, whether as a component of meals, in tea or as a snack.\n- Keep peppermint candies in your purse or at your bedside to manage sudden onset of nausea.\n- Use acupressure bands, especially when traveling or during periods of prolonged activity.\n\n\n### Medical Treatments\n\nWhile many over-the-counter solutions are generally avoided during pregnancy, some safe medications can be used under a doctor's supervision. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new medication.\n\n## When to Seek Medical Help\n\nIt’s important to know when nausea during the third trimester could be a sign of something more serious requiring medical attention.\n\n- **Persistent Vomiting**: If you are unable to keep food or liquids down for 24 hours, it’s important to consult a doctor to avoid dehydration.\n- **Signs of Preeclampsia**: Symptoms like severe headaches, visual disturbances, or upper abdominal pain, particularly under the ribs on the right side, may indicate preeclampsia.\n- **Significant Weight Loss**: Losing weight in pregnancy due to excessive nausea or vomiting needs immediate medical attention.\n- **Symptoms of Dehydration**: These can include feeling [dizzy](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/dehydration-cause-vertigo), having a dry mouth, or producing little to no urine.\n\n### When to Call the Doctor for Third Trimester Nausea:\n\n- If nausea is accompanied by severe headaches or visual changes.\n- If you experience sharp, persistent abdominal pain.\n- If you notice a decrease in baby movement.\n\nFor detailed symptom analysis, consider using the [Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker/symptom-checker-for-women/pregnancy-symptoms) specifically designed for pregnancy.
