These supplements help regulate insulin levels, reduce inflammation, and support overall hormonal health, which is essential for improving quality of life.\n\n![pcos supplements](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2F487cb6ccf7a1f7aca079a255b9dfc4e6.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\nContents\n\n- [What is PCOS?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/pcos-supplements#what-is-pcos)\n- [Why Consider Supplements for PCOS?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/pcos-supplements#why-consider-supplements-for-pcos)\n- [Top 9 PCOS Supplements and Vitamins](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/pcos-supplements#top-9-pcos-supplements-and-vitamins)\n- [Combining Supplements for Enhanced Effectiveness](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/pcos-supplements#combining-supplements-for-enhanced-effectiveness)\n- [Practical Tips for Supplementation](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/pcos-supplements#practical-tips-for-supplementation)\n- [Conclusion](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/pcos-supplements#conclusion)\n\n## What is PCOS?\n\n[Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/pcos-overview) is a common hormonal disorder affecting **8-13%** of women of reproductive age, states [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/polycystic-ovary-syndrome?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwhb60BhClARIsABGGtw_V3V8vuBEpp71bxsITLhebDnbTNr1Mw46GsGVyt8s0P8imu0uoYY8aAgI8EALw_wcB). It is characterized by an excess of androgens, leading to symptoms like insulin resistance, [irregular menstrual cycles](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/8-types-of-abnormal-menstruation), [acne](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/pcos-acne), and weight gain.\n\nWomen with PCOS often have irregular periods or no menstruation due to lack of ovulation. Insulin resistance is prevalent, causing **higher blood sugar levels** and contributing to **weight gain**. Other symptoms include excessive hair growth on the face and body, thinning scalp hair, and persistent acne.\n\nLong-term health risks associated with PCOS include a higher likelihood of developing **type 2 [diabetes](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/diabetes)**, **cardiovascular diseases**, and **metabolic syndrome**. Infertility due to ovulatory dysfunction and mental health issues like depression and anxiety are also common. Managing PCOS effectively through lifestyle changes, medical interventions, and potentially supplements is crucial to mitigate these risks.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Docus AI Symptom Checker\n\nJust 3 simple steps to efficiently understand and manage your health symptoms online.\n\n[Try Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker)\n\n## Why Consider Supplements for PCOS?\n\nSupplements offer natural support for managing PCOS symptoms. They can help address hormonal imbalances, improve insulin sensitivity, and reduce inflammation. Supplements like **inositol**, **vitamin D**, and **omega-3 fatty acids** have shown promise in managing symptoms and improving overall health in women with PCOS.\n\n**It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any supplement regimen**. A doctor can provide personalized advice based on individual health needs and ensure that the supplements won't interfere with any existing medications or conditions. By combining supplements with lifestyle changes, such as a balanced diet and regular exercise, women with PCOS can better manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life.\n\n## Top 9 PCOS Supplements and Vitamins\n\n### Inositol\n\nInositol, specifically myo-inositol and d-chiro-inositol, is a **type of vitamin B8** that plays a vital role in managing PCOS. These forms of inositol help improve insulin sensitivity, which is crucial for women with PCOS. They can also regulate menstrual cycles, and enhance fertility.\n\nInositol is available separately or as a part of multivitamins, which can also strengthen the immune system, and enhance rest, memory, heart health, and reduce anxiety.\n\n#### Scientific Evidence and Benefits\n\n[Research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377527798_Update_on_the_combination_of_myo-inositold-chiro-inositol_for_the_treatment_of_polycystic_ovary_syndrome) from Gynecological Endocrinology has shown that inositol can lower [insulin levels](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/insulin#measuring-insulin-levels) and improve blood sugar control. Studies indicate that women taking myo-inositol have better ovulatory function and higher pregnancy rates. Combining **myo-inositol and d-chiro-inositol in a 40:1** ratio enhances insulin sensitivity and reduces androgen levels, helping with symptoms like acne and excessive hair growth.\n\n#### Alternative Sources\n\n- **Fruits**: Oranges, grapefruits, lemons, bananas, cantaloupes\n- **Vegetables**: Spinach, kale, beans, lentils, peas, Brussels sprouts\n- **Nuts and Seeds**: Almonds, walnuts, sesame seeds\n- **Whole Grains**: Brown rice, oats, whole wheat\n- **Animal Products**: Liver, eggs\n\n### Vitamin D\n\nUp to **85%** of women with PCOS have low levels of vitamin D, as [noted](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4669857/#:~:text=The%20prevalence%20of%20vitamin%20D,%3C20%20ng%2Fml3.) in the Indian Journal of Medical Research. Vitamin D supports menstrual regularity, improves fertility, and boosts mood. Supplementation can enhance insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of [diabetes](https://docus.ai/tags/diabetes). Vitamin D also plays a crucial role in pregnancy health.\n\n#### Alternative Sources\n\n- **Sunlight**: Exposure to sunlight enables the body to produce Vitamin D.\n- **Fatty Fish**: Salmon, mackerel, sardines, and tuna.\n- **Egg Yolks**: Contain small amounts of Vitamin D.\n\n### Curcumin\n\nCurcumin, found in turmeric, is known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It helps regulate inflammation, which is often high in PCOS, reduce insulin resistance, and regulate androgen levels.\n\n#### Scientific Evidence and Benefits\n\n[Studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32220355/) from Clinical Nutrition ESPEN show that curcumin can improve insulin resistance and lower androgen levels. It also helps with ovulation and reduces symptoms like acne.\n\n#### Alternative Sources\n\n- **Foods**: Turmeric spice added to dishes like curries, soups, and smoothies.\n- **Drinks**: Turmeric tea or golden milk.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Your Personal AI Doctor\n\nCustomize your AI Doctor to ask any health-related questions. Get instant answers and tailored health insights.\n\n[Get Started](https://docus.ai/ai-doctor)\n\n### Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n\nOmega-3 fatty acids are essential for reducing inflammation and managing PCOS symptoms. They improve insulin resistance and [cholesterol](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/cholesterol) levels, making them valuable for overall metabolic health.\n\n#### Scientific Evidence and Benefits\n\nReproductive Biology and Endocrinology [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5870911/) indicates that omega-3 supplements can lower insulin resistance and triglyceride levels. They also improve mood and mental health, which are often affected by PCOS.\n\n#### Alternative options\n\n- **Fatty Fish**: Salmon, mackerel, sardines, and tuna are rich in omega-3s.\n- **Chia Seeds**: High in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), a type of omega-3.\n- **Flaxseeds**: Another excellent source of ALA.\n- **Walnuts**: Contain ALA.\n- **Algal Oil**: Derived from algae, a plant-based source of DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid).\n\n### CoQ10\n\nCoenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an antioxidant that helps with energy production, and metabolic and inflammatory issues related to PCOS. It improves blood sugar control, lowers [cholesterol levels](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/cholesterol#cholesterol-levels-by-age-and-sex), and enhances fertility.\n\n#### Scientific Evidence and Benefits\n\nJournal of Diabetes & Metabolic Disorders [noted](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4583053/) in the study that CoQ10 can improve blood sugar control, lower cholesterol levels, and enhance fertility.\n\n#### Alternative Sources\n\n- **Foods**: Organ meats (liver, heart), fatty fish (trout, sardines), spinach, broccoli, and cauliflower.\n\n### Berberine\n\nBerberine is known for improving insulin resistance and metabolic health. It has shown similar efficacy to metformin, making it a popular natural alternative. Berberine can lower blood sugar levels and improve lipid profiles, aiding in the overall management of PCOS symptoms.\n\n#### Scientific Evidence and Benefits\n\n[MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1729/13/1/125) suggests that berberine can lower blood sugar levels and improve ovulation rates, similar to metformin.\n\n#### Alternative Sources\n\n- **Natural sources**: Goldenseal, barberry, Oregon grape, and tree turmeric.\n\n### Magnesium\n\nMagnesium is vital for glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. It helps reduce insulin resistance, making it crucial for managing PCOS. Magnesium supplements should be in forms like magnesium glycinate or citrate for better absorption.\n\n#### Scientific Evidence and Benefits\n\nStudies published in [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28392498/) show that magnesium can improve insulin sensitivity and reduce PMS and menstrual cramps.\n\n#### Alternative sources\n\n- **Leafy Greens**: Spinach, kale\n- **Nuts and Seeds**: Almonds, cashews, pumpkin seeds\n- **Whole Grains**: Brown rice, whole wheat\n- **Legumes**: Black beans, lentils\n- **Fish**: Mackerel, salmon\n- **Avocados**: A rich source of magnesium\n\n### Zinc\n\nZinc helps regulate hormones and immune function, which are often disrupted in women with PCOS. It may also alleviate symptoms like acne and hair loss associated with the condition.\n\n#### Scientific Evidence and Benefits\n\nMDPI Nutrients [indicate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7468694/) that zinc can improve insulin sensitivity, reduce oxidative stress, and enhance menstrual regularity.\n\n#### Alternative Sources\n\n- **Meat**: Beef, pork, lamb\n- **Shellfish**: Oysters, crab, shrimp\n- **Legumes**: Chickpeas, lentils, beans\n- **Nuts and Seeds**: Pumpkin seeds, cashews\n- **Dairy**: Cheese, milk\n- **Whole Grains**: Quinoa, whole wheat\n- **Eggs**: A good source of zinc\n\n### B-Complex Vitamins\n\nB-complex vitamins, including B12, B6, and [folate](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/folate-blood-test), are essential for managing PCOS symptoms. They help with insulin resistance and mood regulation. B-Complex supplements can boost energy levels and improve metabolic functions. To avoid the hassle of taking them separately, find these vitamins in Complete Multivitamin.\n\n#### Scientific Evidence and Benefits\n\n[Vitamin B12](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/vitamin-b12) is crucial for those taking metformin, and it can lower B12 levels. B6 and folate support energy levels and hormonal balance, notes [Gov.UK](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/metformin-and-reduced-vitamin-b12-levels-new-advice-for-monitoring-patients-at-risk).\n\n#### Alternative Sources\n\n- **Meat**: Beef, pork, chicken\n- **Fish**: Salmon, tuna, trout\n- **Eggs**: A good source of B vitamins\n- **Dairy**: Milk, cheese, yogurt\n- **Whole Grains**: Brown rice, whole wheat, oats\n- **Legumes**: Lentils, beans, chickpeas\n- **Leafy Greens**: Spinach, kale\n- **Nuts and Seeds**: Almonds, sunflower seeds\n\n**Note**: _Do not exceed the recommended dose. Pregnant or nursing mothers, children under 18, and individuals with known medical conditions should consult a healthcare professional before using any dietary supplement, as some supplements can interact with medications or worsen health issues._\n\n## Combining Supplements for Enhanced Effectiveness\n\nCombining certain supplements can enhance their effectiveness in managing PCOS symptoms:\n\n- **Inositol and d-chiro-inositol**: A 40:1 ratio significantly improves insulin sensitivity and reduces androgen levels.\n- **Inositol and alpha-lipoic acid**: Enhances insulin sensitivity and reduces inflammation.\n- **CoQ10 and omega-3 fatty acids**: Synergistically reduce oxidative stress and improve cardiovascular health.\n- **Vitamin D and magnesium**: Improve absorption and effectiveness of both supplements.\n\n**Note**: Always consult a healthcare provider before combining supplements to ensure safety and effectiveness. A healthcare professional can provide personalized recommendations based on individual health needs and ensure that the supplements do not interfere with existing medications or conditions.\n\n## Practical Tips for Supplementation\n\n- **With Meals**: Take omega-3 fatty acids and CoQ10 with meals to improve absorption..\n- **Diet**: Incorporate nutrient-rich foods like leafy greens, lean proteins, and healthy fats to support overall health.\n- **Lifestyle Changes**: Regular physical activity and stress management techniques, such as yoga or meditation, can help manage PCOS symptoms.\n- **Establish a Routine**: Take your supplements at the same time each day. Use a pill organizer or set reminders on your phone.\n- **Track Progress**: Keep a journal to note any changes in symptoms or side effects.
