While Type 1 is caused by an autoimmune reaction, Type 2 is often linked to lifestyle factors like obesity and inactivity. Proper management is critical to avoiding serious health complications.\n\n![type 1 vs type 2 diabetes](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2Fdda9c1c2ec6b4d9c1dcb977d04c84f7a.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\nContents\n\n- [Diabetes and Its Types](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/type-1-vs-type-2-diabetes#diabetes-and-its-types)\n- [Symptoms](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/type-1-vs-type-2-diabetes#symptoms)\n- [Causes and Risk Factors](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/type-1-vs-type-2-diabetes#causes-and-risk-factors)\n- [Diagnosis](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/type-1-vs-type-2-diabetes#diagnosis)\n- [Treatment](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/type-1-vs-type-2-diabetes#treatment)\n- [Key Takeaways](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/type-1-vs-type-2-diabetes#key-takeaways)\n\n## Diabetes and Its Types\n\n[Diabetes](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/diabetes) is a chronic condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. In 2021, **537 million adults** aged 20–79, or 1 in 10, were living with diabetes.\n\nNormally, your body breaks down food into [glucose](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/glucose) (sugar), which enters your bloodstream. [Insulin](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/insulin), a hormone produced by the pancreas, helps glucose get into your cells to be used as energy.\n\nWhen you have diabetes, this process doesn’t work properly. Either your body doesn’t make enough insulin, or it can’t use the insulin it does make effectively. This leads to high blood sugar levels, which can cause serious health problems over time, such as heart disease, kidney damage, and vision loss.\n\nThere are several types of diabetes, but the two most common are **Type 1** and **Type 2**.\n\nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder where the body attacks the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn’t produce enough of it.\n\nIn adults, Type 1 diabetes makes up about **5-10%** of all diagnosed diabetes cases, while Type 2 diabetes accounts for approximately **90-95%**.\n\nOther types include:\n\n- **Gestational Diabetes:** Develops during [pregnancy](https://docus.ai/tags/pregnancy) and usually goes away after childbirth.\n- **MODY (Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young):** A rare form caused by a genetic mutation.\n- **LADA (Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults):** A slow-progressing form of Type 1 diabetes in adults.\n\n## Symptoms\n\n### Similarities\n\nBoth Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes can cause **increased thirst** and **frequent urination** due to excess glucose in the blood, leading to dehydration.\n\n[**Fatigue**](https://docus.ai/tags/fatigue) is common in both types, as the body struggles to use glucose for energy, whether due to a lack of insulin or insulin resistance.\n\nHigh blood sugar can also cause **blurred vision** by affecting the shape of the eye's lens.\n\nAdditionally, both types **impair wound healing** and increase the risk of infections due to damage to blood vessels and nerves.\n\n### Differences\n\n#### Type 1 Diabetes\n\n- **Onset of Symptoms**: Symptoms often appear suddenly and can be severe due to the rapid loss of insulin production.\n- **Unintended** [**Weight Loss**](https://docus.ai/tags/weight-loss): Common in Type 1 diabetes as the body breaks down muscle and fat for energy when it can't access glucose.\n- **Presence of Ketoacidosis**: Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is more common in Type 1 diabetes, a serious condition caused by high levels of blood acids [(ketones)](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/ketones-in-blood) due to insulin deficiency.\n\n#### Type 2 Diabetes\n\n- **Onset of Symptoms**: Symptoms develop gradually and are often milder, sometimes going unnoticed until complications arise.\n- **Weight Gain**: More common in Type 2 diabetes, particularly around the abdomen, due to insulin resistance and the body's reduced ability to process glucose.\n- **Ketoacidosis**: Rare in Type 2 diabetes, though it can occur under extreme conditions, such as severe illness or prolonged uncontrolled diabetes.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Docus AI Symptom Checker\n\nJust 3 simple steps to efficiently understand and manage your health symptoms online.\n\n[Try Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker)\n\n## Causes and Risk Factors\n\n### Similarities\n\nBoth Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes have **genetic components**, with a family history increasing the risk of developing either type, though different genes are involved.\n\nThe **immune system** plays a role in both types; in Type 1, it's more direct with autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing cells, while in Type 2, autoimmune processes can contribute, especially in LADA.\n\n**Environmental factors** like viral infections can trigger Type 1, while lifestyle factors such as diet and physical activity are more significant in Type 2, though they can also impact Type 1.\n\n### Differences\n\n#### Type 1 Diabetes\n\n- **Autoimmune Destruction**: The primary cause of Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune response where the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. This leads to a complete lack of insulin production.\n- **Childhood or Early Onset**: Type 1 diabetes often develops in childhood or adolescence, though it can occur at any age. The triggers are not fully understood but may include genetic predisposition combined with environmental factors, such as viral infections.\n\n#### Type 2 Diabetes\n\n- **Insulin Resistance**: Type 2 diabetes primarily develops due to insulin resistance, where the body’s cells become less responsive to insulin. This resistance often worsens over time, leading to elevated blood sugar levels.\n- **Lifestyle and Obesity**: Unlike Type 1, Type 2 diabetes is strongly associated with lifestyle factors, particularly obesity, poor diet, and physical inactivity. These factors can lead to or exacerbate insulin resistance.\n- **Adult Onset**: Type 2 diabetes typically develops in adulthood, especially after the age of 45, although it is increasingly seen in younger populations due to rising obesity rates. Genetics play a significant role, but the impact is more strongly modulated by lifestyle factors.\n\n## Diagnosis\n\n### Similarities\n\nDiagnosing both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes typically involves similar [blood glucose tests](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/glucose#types-of-glucose-tests) to measure blood glucose levels.\n\nCommon diagnostic tests include the **Fasting Blood Glucose Test**, which measures blood sugar after you haven't eaten for at least eight hours, and the **A1C Test**, which provides an average of your blood glucose levels over the past two to three months.\n\n### Differences\n\n#### Type 1 Diabetes\n\nIn addition to the standard blood glucose tests, diagnosing Type 1 diabetes often involves:\n\n- **Autoantibody Tests:** These tests detect the presence of specific antibodies that attack insulin-producing cells, confirming the autoimmune nature of Type 1 diabetes.\n- **C-Peptide Test:** Measures the levels of C-peptide, a byproduct of insulin production, which are typically low or absent in Type 1 diabetes.\n\n#### Type 2 Diabetes\n\nDiagnosing Type 2 diabetes may also involve:\n\n- **Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT):** Measures how your body processes glucose over a few hours after drinking a sugary solution.\n- [**Insulin Levels**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/insulin#measuring-insulin-levels) **:** [Blood tests](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview) may measure insulin levels to assess insulin resistance.\n\n## Treatment\n\n### Similarities\n\nBoth Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes require regular blood sugar monitoring to manage the condition and prevent complications.\n\nA **healthy diet**, focusing on controlling carbohydrates and maintaining a consistent meal schedule, is essential for both types.\n\n**Regular physical activity** is also recommended to improve insulin sensitivity and control blood sugar levels.\n\n**Insulin therapy** is central to Type 1 diabetes but may be used in Type 2 if other treatments are insufficient.\n\n### Differences\n\n#### Type 1 Diabetes\n\nType 1 diabetes is characterized by the body’s inability to produce insulin. Therefore, daily insulin injections or an insulin pump are necessary for survival. Type 1 diabetes usually requires immediate and lifelong treatment upon diagnosis to manage blood glucose levels and prevent complications.\n\n#### Type 2 Diabetes\n\nType 2 diabetes is often initially managed with oral medications that help the body use insulin more effectively or stimulate insulin production. These are typically the first line of treatment before insulin therapy is considered. In many cases, Type 2 diabetes can be managed with lifestyle changes alone, particularly in the early stages.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder that requires lifelong insulin therapy, while Type 2 diabetes is often linked to lifestyle factors and can sometimes be managed or even reversed with lifestyle changes.\n- Both types of diabetes share common symptoms like increased thirst, frequent urination, and fatigue, but they differ in how quickly these symptoms appear and their severity.\n- Proper diagnosis and treatment are essential for managing diabetes and preventing serious complications like heart disease, nerve damage, and kidney failure.\n- Maintaining a healthy lifestyle with regular monitoring, a balanced diet, and physical activity is crucial for managing both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes effectively.\n\n#### Sources\n\n- [International Diabetes Federation (IDF)](https://idf.org/about-diabetes/diabetes-facts-figures/)\n- [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/communication-resources/diabetes-statistics.html)\n- [National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/symptoms-causes)\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
