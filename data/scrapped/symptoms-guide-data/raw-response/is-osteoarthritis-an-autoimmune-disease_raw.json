This disease wears down the cartilage, causing pain, swelling, and difficulty moving joints. Unlike some forms of arthritis, osteoarthritis is not an autoimmune disease but results from mechanical wear and tear over time.\n\nOsteoarthritis can impact any joint, commonly affecting the hands, feet, back, legs, knees, and hips. The degeneration of cartilage and bones significantly impacts daily life.\n\nAccording to the [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/osteoarthritis#:~:text=Key%20facts,%25%20are%20female%20(1).), with aging populations and increasing rates of obesity and injury, the prevalence of osteoarthritis is expected to rise globally.\n\nAs the cartilage breaks down, bones rub together, causing further damage and inflammation. This can lead to bone spurs, small growths that develop on the edges of bones, making joint movement painful and restricting mobility.\n\n### Symptoms of Osteoarthritis\n\nRecognizing the symptoms of osteoarthritis is crucial for early diagnosis and management. Here are the main symptoms:\n\n- **Joint Pain**: Pain ranging from mild discomfort to severe pain that limits daily activities, often worsening with activity and improving with rest.\n- **Swelling**: Inflammation in the joint leads to swelling, making the joint appear larger and feel warm to the touch.\n- **Stiffness**: Noticeable stiffness, especially after periods of inactivity, which usually improves with gentle movement.\n- **Loss of Mobility and Flexibility**: Difficulty in performing activities that involve bending or moving the affected joints.\n- **Tenderness**: Joints may become tender to the touch, causing pain when pressure is applied.\n- **Popping or [Cracking Sounds](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/crunchy-knees-explained)**: Known as crepitus, these sounds occur when the roughened surfaces of the cartilage and bones rub against each other.\n- **Sensation of Bones Grating Together**: As the cartilage wears away, the sensation of bone grating can occur, leading to further discomfort and functional limitations.\n\nRecognizing these symptoms early and consulting with a healthcare professional can lead to a better management plan, potentially slowing the progression of osteoarthritis.\n\nOnline Symptom Checker can be usefulÂ [for checking symptoms](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker) and identifying the causes. However, it is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Docus AI Symptom Checker\n\nJust 3 simple steps to efficiently understand and manage your health symptoms online.\n\n[Try Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker)\n\n### Causes of Osteoarthritis\n\nUnderstanding the causes of osteoarthritis can help in managing and potentially preventing the condition. Here are the main risk factors:\n\n- **Age**: The risk of developing osteoarthritis increases with age. As people get older, the wear and tear on their joints accumulate, leading to the degeneration of cartilage.\n- **Gender**: Women are more likely to develop osteoarthritis than men. Hormonal changes, especially after [menopause](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/about-menopause), might contribute to this increased risk.\n- **Physical Injury or Trauma**: Previous injuries to joints or ligaments can lead to osteoarthritis. Damage from sports, accidents, or repetitive stress can cause long-term joint issues.\n- **Weak Muscles**: Muscles support and stabilize joints. When muscles are weak, the joints experience higher strain, which can accelerate cartilage breakdown.\n- **Weight Gain**: Obesity puts additional stress on weight-bearing joints like the knees and hips. This increased load can speed up the wear and tear of cartilage.\n- **Hereditary Factors**: Genetics can play a role in the development of osteoarthritis. If family members have had joint problems, there may be an increased risk of developing the condition.\n\nThese risk factors highlight the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle and seeking early medical advice if symptoms of osteoarthritis appear.\n\n## Is Osteoarthritis an Autoimmune Disease?\n\nOsteoarthritis is **not an autoimmune disease**. It is a chronic condition that results from the mechanical wear and tear of the joints over time.\n\nUnlike autoimmune diseases, like **rheumatoid arthritis**, where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its tissues, osteoarthritis involves the gradual breakdown of cartilage due to physical stress and aging.\n\nThis distinction is crucial for understanding the nature of osteoarthritis and its management.\n\n## How Is Osteoarthritis Different From Rheumatoid Arthritis?\n\nUnderstanding the differences between osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis is essential for proper diagnosis and treatment. Here is an in-depth comparison between the two conditions:\n\n### Age of Onset:\n\n- Osteoarthritis usually starts **after age 50**.\n- Rheumatoid arthritis typically begins **between ages 30 and 60**.\n\n### Affected Joints:\n\n- Osteoarthritis often affects weight-bearing joints such as the **feet**, hips, **knees**, and **spine**.\n- Rheumatoid arthritis commonly impacts **smaller joints**, such as those in the hands and feet.\n\n### Symptoms:\n\n- **Osteoarthritis**: Causes joint pain and swelling, which can be worse after activity and improve with rest.\n- **Rheumatoid Arthritis**: Leads to symptoms of heat, pain, redness, stiffness, and joint tenderness due to inflammation.\n\n### Symmetry of Symptoms:\n\n- Osteoarthritis pain is usually **asymmetrical**, affecting one side of the body more than the other.\n- Rheumatoid arthritis pain is **symmetrical**, meaning it affects the same joints on both sides of the body.\n\n### Diagnostic Differences:\n\n- **Osteoarthritis**: May show bony growths ( **osteophytes**) and joint space narrowing on X-rays.\n- **Rheumatoid Arthritis**: [Blood tests](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview) may reveal **inflammation** and **anemia**. X-rays and other imaging can show bone erosion and joint deformities.\n\nUnderstanding these differences helps in identifying the correct type of arthritis and pursuing the appropriate treatment. If you experience joint pain and other related symptoms, consulting with a healthcare professional is crucial. Early and accurate diagnosis can lead to better management and improved quality of life.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Can osteoarthritis be prevented?\n\nWhile osteoarthritis cannot be completely prevented, certain lifestyle changes can reduce the risk. Maintaining a healthy weight, staying active with low-impact exercises, and avoiding joint injuries can help manage the wear and tear on joints, potentially delaying the onset of osteoarthritis.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# How is osteoarthritis diagnosed if it's not an autoimmune disease?\n\nOsteoarthritis is diagnosed through a combination of physical examinations, patient history, and imaging tests like X-rays or MRIs. These tests help doctors see the extent of cartilage damage and bone changes in the joints. Unlike autoimmune diseases, blood tests are not typically used to diagnose osteoarthritis.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What are the best ways to manage osteoarthritis symptoms?\n\nManaging osteoarthritis involves a combination of lifestyle changes and medical treatments. Regular physical activity, weight management, and physical therapy can help maintain joint function and reduce pain. Additionally, your healthcare provider may recommend medications or other treatments to manage symptoms effectively.\n\nHave more questions? [Ask AI Doctor](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/is-osteoarthritis-an-autoimmune-disease#ask-your-question)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, osteoarthritis is a chronic joint condition caused by the mechanical wear and tear of cartilage over time. It is not an autoimmune disease, which sets it apart from conditions like rheumatoid arthritis that involve the immune system attacking the body's own tissues.\n\nUnderstanding the differences between these types of arthritis is essential for accurate diagnosis and effective management. Recognizing the symptoms early and consulting with healthcare professionals can help in creating a comprehensive treatment plan that can improve quality of life.\n\nRemember, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, managing weight, and seeking timely medical advice are key steps in managing osteoarthritis.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
