While sunspots are harmless signs of sun exposure, melanoma is a serious skin cancer that requires immediate attention.\n\nKnowing the differences can help you protect your skin and recognize potential problems early.\n\n![Sunspots vs Melanoma](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2Fa0e10341d4d05da12fda791c93e2a1f1.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\nContents\n\n- [What Are Sunspots?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/sun-spots-vs-melanoma#what-are-sunspots)\n- [What Is Melanoma?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/sun-spots-vs-melanoma#what-is-melanoma)\n- [Sunspots vs Melanoma: Key Differences](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/sun-spots-vs-melanoma#sunspots-vs-melanoma-key-differences)\n- [Can Sunspots Turn Into Melanoma?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/sun-spots-vs-melanoma#can-sunspots-turn-into-melanoma)\n- [Diagnostics](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/sun-spots-vs-melanoma#diagnostics)\n- [Prevention Tips for Healthy Skin](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/sun-spots-vs-melanoma#prevention-tips-for-healthy-skin)\n- [How Are Sunspots and Melanoma Treated?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/sun-spots-vs-melanoma#how-are-sunspots-and-melanoma-treated)\n- [Conclusion](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/sun-spots-vs-melanoma#conclusion)\n\n## What Are Sunspots?\n\nSunspots, also called **age spots** or **liver spots**, are flat, dark areas on the skin. They usually show up on parts of the body that get the most sunlight, like the **face**, **hands**, **shoulders**, and **arms**.\n\n### How Do Sunspots Look?\n\n- **Color:** Light brown, tan, or darker than your normal skin tone.\n- **Size:** They can be small like freckles or bigger patches.\n- **Shape:** Usually round or oval with smooth edges.\n\nDr. Cameron Rokhsar, Founder & Medical Director of the [New York Cosmetic Skin & Laser Surgery Center](https://cosmeticlaserskinsurgery.com/), explains:\n\n_\"Sunspots, or what we call lentigo, are usually light brown and uniform in shape, color, and contour. Although they can grow, this is a slow, gradual process…\"_\n\n![sunspots](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2F7403bc12bc2c8c9e210b5ee25100ea6c.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n### What Causes Sunspots?\n\nSunspots form when the skin produces too much **melanin**, the pigment responsible for skin color. Its production increases **after exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays** from the sun.\n\nOver time, the skin becomes less effective at removing melanin. This buildup of melanin leads to the formation of dark spots.\n\nAlso, as we age, the skin becomes more sensitive to UV rays, which is why sunspots are more common in older adults.\n\nPeople with lighter skin tend to notice sun spots more easily, but they can develop on anyone with enough sun exposure.\n\n### Are Sunspots Dangerous?\n\nSunspots are harmless and don’t cause health problems. However, they can look similar to other skin issues, like **melanoma**.\n\n## What Is Melanoma?\n\n[Melanoma](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/melanoma) is a serious type of **skin cancer** that develops in **melanocytes**. These are the cells that produce melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color.\n\nMelanoma often appears as an **unusual mole** or **dark spot on the skin**. It can develop anywhere on the body, but it’s more common in **sun-exposed areas** like the face, arms, and back.\n\n_“...Melanomas, on the other hand, are dark, irregularly pigmented, have irregular borders and contours, and are asymmetric.”,_ continues Dr. Cameron Rokhsar.\n\nThis aggressive cancer is often triggered by DNA damage in melanocytes caused by ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or tanning beds. Factors like **fair skin**, **frequent sunburns**, or a **family history** of melanoma can increase your risk.\n\nResearchers have also discovered specific genetic changes in mole cells that may cause them to turn into melanoma. However, it’s _still unclear why this happens in some moles and not others_.\n\nUnlike other skin conditions, melanoma can spread quickly to other body parts if not detected and treated early. It makes melanoma **one of the most dangerous forms of skin cancer**.\n\n![melanoma example](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2F99234bd7738e6dc4d339500835865256.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n_Picture of a melanoma from a new, dark lesion on the skin_\n\n**_Source_**: [_https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/melanoma/pictures-abnormal-moles-skin-change_](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/melanoma/pictures-abnormal-moles-skin-changes)\n\n### ABCDE Rule for Self-Exam\n\nThe ABCDE rule is a simple way to spot melanoma early and potentially save lives:\n\n- **A: Asymmetry:** One half of the spot doesn’t match the other half, giving it an uneven shape.\n- **B: Border Irregularity:** The edges are uneven, jagged, or blurred rather than smooth.\n- **C: Color Variation:** The spot has multiple colors, such as shades of black, brown, red, white, or blue.\n- **D: Diameter:** Melanomas are often larger than 6 millimeters, about the size of a pencil eraser. However, they can be smaller when first detected.\n- **E: Evolving:** The spot changes over time in size, shape, or color, or it starts to itch, bleed, or crust.\n\nIf you notice any of these features, it’s important to have the area checked by a **dermatologist**.\n\nRegular self-exams can help you spot suspicious changes early.\n\n### Why Early Detection Matters\n\nDetecting melanoma early can make a significant difference in treatment outcomes. In its early stages, melanoma is highly treatable and can often be removed surgically.\n\nHowever, once it spreads to other parts of the body, it becomes much more difficult to manage. This is why it’s essential to regularly check your skin for new or changing spots and consult a dermatologist if you notice anything unusual.\n\n## Sunspots vs Melanoma: Key Differences\n\n| Feature | Sunspots | Melanoma |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cause | UV exposure and aging | DNA damage from UV or genetic factors |\n| Color | Typically one uniform shade (light brown or tan) | Multiple colors like brown, black, red, or white |\n| Feel | Flat and smooth, blends with the skin | Raised, rough, or different texture |\n| Growth | Stable, no growth | Rapid growth, changing shape |\n| Danger Level | Harmless | Potentially life-threatening |\n| Treatment | Cosmetic (optional) | Urgent medical intervention required |\n\nIf you’re ever unsure about a spot, it’s better to get it checked.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Docus AI Symptom Checker\n\nJust 3 simple steps to efficiently understand and manage your health symptoms online.\n\n[Try Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker)\n\n## Can Sunspots Turn Into Melanoma?\n\nNo, sunspots do not turn into melanoma. However, having sunspots may signal significant UV damage, which increases your overall risk of developing melanoma.\n\n## Diagnostics\n\nA dermatologist will first conduct a visual examination using a **dermatoscope**, a tool that magnifies and illuminates the skin. This allows them to closely inspect the structure, pattern, and color of a mole or lesion.\n\nIf a spot looks suspicious, the doctor may recommend a **skin biopsy**. This procedure is the gold standard for diagnosing melanoma.\n\nDuring the biopsy:\n\n- A small sample of the suspicious skin is removed.\n- The sample is sent to a laboratory, where specialists examine it under a microscope for signs of cancer.\n\nThe type of biopsy performed (shave, punch, or excisional) depends on the size and location of the lesion.\n\nA visual exam and biopsy help dermatologists tell melanoma apart from sun spots and other skin conditions, ensuring proper care.\n\n## Prevention Tips for Healthy Skin\n\nProtecting your skin can reduce the risk of sun damage and melanoma. Follow these simple tips:\n\n- **Use Sunscreen Daily:** The [AAD](https://www.aad.org/public/everyday-care/sun-protection/shade-clothing-sunscreen/how-to-apply-sunscreen) recommends using SPF 30+ sunscreen daily, even on cloudy days. Reapply every two hours and after swimming or sweating.\n- **Cover Up:** Wear long sleeves, hats, and sunglasses, especially between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. when the sun is strongest.\n- **Skip Tanning Beds:** Tanning beds increase the risk of melanoma and other skin cancers. Research shows that using tanning beds before age 20 raises your melanoma risk by **[47%](https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/skin-cancer/surprising-facts-about-indoor-tanning#:~:text=Indoor%20tanning%20can%20increase%20the,basal%20cell%20carcinoma%20by%2024%25.&text=Using%20tanning%20beds%20before%20age,risk%20increases%20with%20each%20use.)**, and the risk grows with each use.\n- **Monthly Self-Checks:** Look for new or changing spots, especially on areas exposed to the sun like your face and hands.\n\n## How Are Sunspots and Melanoma Treated?\n\n### Treatment for Sunspots\n\nSunspots are harmless and typically don’t require treatment. However, some people choose cosmetic procedures to lighten or remove them for aesthetic reasons.\n\nCommon options include:\n\n- **Laser Therapy:** Uses light energy to target and reduce pigmentation in the spots.\n- **Chemical Peels:** Removes the top layers of skin to improve the appearance of sunspots.\n- **Cryotherapy:** Freezes the spots with liquid nitrogen, causing them to fade over time.\n\n### Treatment for Melanoma\n\nMelanoma is a serious skin cancer and requires immediate medical intervention. Treatment options depend on the stage of the cancer:\n\n- **Surgical Excision:** The primary treatment involves removing the melanoma along with some surrounding healthy tissue.\n- **Follow-Up Care:** Regular checkups ensure that the melanoma has not returned or spread.\n- **Additional Treatments:** In advanced stages, treatments may include immunotherapy, radiation therapy, or targeted drug therapy to address cancer that has spread.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What happens if melanoma is untreated?\n\nIf left untreated, melanoma can grow deeper into the skin and spread to other parts of the body, including the lymph nodes and organs. This makes it more difficult to treat and can become life-threatening.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# How often should I check my skin for melanoma?\n\nIt’s recommended to perform a self-skin exam every month and visit a dermatologist annually for a professional skin check. If you have a personal or family history of skin cancer, you may need more frequent visits.\n\nHave more questions?
