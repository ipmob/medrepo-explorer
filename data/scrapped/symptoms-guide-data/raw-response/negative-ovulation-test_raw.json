This hormone increases, or \"surges,\" just before your ovary releases an egg. The test detects this surge to let you know that ovulation is likely to happen within the next **24 to 36 hours.**\n\nOnce ovulation happens, the egg is released and stays available for fertilization for about **12 to 24 hours**. This is the key window when conception is most likely, and ovulation tests help you time it perfectly.\n\nIt's important to remember, that sperm can live inside the female reproductive system for **up to 5 days**. That means intercourse even a few days before ovulation can result in pregnancy.\n\nTracking ovulation with these tests can be especially helpful if you're trying to conceive, as it identifies the best time for fertilization to occur.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that ovulation tests are designed to predict ovulation, not to prevent pregnancy.\n\nIf you’re not trying to conceive, use a reliable method of contraception instead.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Your Personal AI Doctor\n\nCustomize your AI Doctor to ask any health-related questions. Get instant answers and tailored health insights.\n\n[Get Started](https://docus.ai/ai-doctor)\n\n## What Does a Negative Ovulation Test Mean?\n\nA negative ovulation test means that the **test did not detect a surge in luteinizing hormone (LH)** in your urine. This indicates that ovulation has not occurred yet, and without it, pregnancy cannot happen.\n\n### What Does a Negative Ovulation Test Look Like?\n\nWhen using an [ovulation test strip](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/ovulation-test-strips), you’ll always see a **control line**. This line shows the test is working. After taking the test, you might see a second line called the **test line**.\n\n- **Negative Result:** If the second line doesn’t appear at all, the result is negative, meaning no [LH surge](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/lh-surge) was detected.\n- **Positive Result:** A [positive result](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/decoding-positive-ovulation-test) happens when the test line is as dark or darker than the control line, showing an LH surge and that ovulation is near.\n- **Uncertain Result:** If the test line is lighter than the control line or very faint, the result is unclear. This could indicate either a negative or a very early LH surge. In this case, it’s best to test again later in the day or the following day for a clearer result or consult a doctor.\n\nOn digital tests, a negative result might display as a blank circle, a flat line, or another neutral symbol, depending on the brand.\n\nTo better understand how to interpret the results, look at the image below. It shows examples of both negative and positive results for strip-style and digital ovulation tests.\n\n![ovulation test results](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2F748279f1692dcc130d1149805e3d66ee.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\nExamples of negative and positive ovulation test results on both strip-style and digital ovulation tests.\n\n**Source**: [https://www.invitra.com/en/ovulation-test/](https://www.invitra.com/en/ovulation-test/)\n\nOn the test strips, the test on the left demonstrates a negative result, where the test line is very faint or absent, while the test on the right shows a positive result, indicating an LH surge.\n\n### The Causes of a Negative Ovulation Test\n\nA negative ovulation test can be frustrating, but it doesn’t always mean you’re not ovulating.\n\nOvulation tests, while helpful, are not perfect and can sometimes give **false negatives** or even **false positives**.\n\nSeveral factors can influence the results:\n\n#### 1\\. Testing Too Early or Late\n\nTake ovulation tests during your fertile window for the most accurate results. Testing too early or too late in your cycle might cause you to miss the LH surge.\n\nThe [UNC School of Medicine](https://www.med.unc.edu/timetoconceive/study-participant-resources/ovulation-predictor-test-instructions/) suggests starting ovulation tests based on your cycle length, as shown in the table below.\n\n| Your Usual Cycle Length | Day to Begin Testing |\n| --- | --- |\n| Less than 26 days | Day 6 |\n| 27–29 days | Day 8 |\n| 30 – 35 Days | Day 10 |\n| More than 35 days | Day 12 |\n| Too irregular to tell | Day 8 |\n\nRemember, these dates are approximate, so testing regularly during your fertile window can help you catch the LH surge.\n\nKeep track of your cycle length to figure out the right days to test.\n\n#### 2\\. Short or Irregular LH Surges\n\nNot everyone has the same hormonal patterns. Some people experience a very brief LH surge that can be easy to miss if you’re only testing once a day.\n\nTesting twice daily during your expected fertile days can increase your chances of catching the surge.\n\n#### 3\\. Diluted Urine\n\nDrinking a lot of water before testing can dilute your urine, making it harder for the test to detect LH. To get accurate results, avoid drinking large amounts of fluids for at least two hours before testing.\n\n#### 4\\. Irregular Cycles\n\nIrregular cycles make it harder to predict ovulation. Without a regular cycle, it can take more time to figure out your fertile window.\n\nHowever, “ _You should not be tracking your ovulation if your periods are irregular… If your period is irregular, number one, go and see a doctor_”, [says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-_Tp0MM8jY) Natalie Crawford, MD, Reproductive Endocrinologist and Infertility Specialist.\n\n#### 5\\. Underlying Medical Conditions\n\nSometimes, hormonal imbalances caused by conditions like [polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/pcos-overview) or [thyroid issues](https://docus.ai/tags/thyroid-issues) can affect LH levels.\n\n“ _Remember that with PCOS you have an elevated basal lh level, so you’re more likely to get a false positive result_ ”, continues Dr. Crawford.\n\nFor example, a [study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10478661/) confirms that elevated LH level is a frequent symptom of PCOS. These hormone levels might stay high or go up and down multiple times, which can falsely reflect the ovulation.\n\nIf you frequently have negative results despite regular testing, it’s a good idea to consult a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying causes.\n\n#### 6\\. Stress\n\nHigh stress levels can interfere with your hormonal balance and delay or suppress ovulation.\n\nThis may result in negative ovulation tests, even if you're testing during your fertile window.\n\nStress management, such as through relaxation techniques, regular exercise, or adequate sleep, can help regulate your cycle and improve the accuracy of ovulation tracking.\n\n## What to Do After a Negative Ovulation Test?\n\nGetting a negative ovulation test result can be disheartening, but it’s important not to jump to conclusions. A single negative result doesn’t mean ovulation won’t happen. Here are some practical steps to take next:\n\n### Don’t Panic and Keep Testing\n\nNegative ovulation tests are common and don’t always mean there’s a problem. Ovulation timing can vary, so stay calm and keep testing.\n\nTo increase your chances of catching the LH surge, test consistently during your fertile window, ideally twice a day—morning and afternoon.\n\n### Monitor Other Ovulation Signs\n\nSometimes, ovulation tests alone might not give you the full picture. Paying attention to your body’s natural signs can help:\n\n1. **Cervical Mucus Changes:** Near ovulation, mucus becomes clear, slippery, and stretchy, like raw egg whites, helping sperm move easily.\n2. **Basal Body Temperature (BBT):** After ovulation, your resting temperature rises slightly **(about 0.5°F or 0.3°C)**. Tracking this can show ovulation patterns over time. However, “Charting monthly temperature changes can confirm ovulation but it cannot predict it”, as per [ACOG](https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/evaluating-infertility).\n3. **Ovulation Pain (Mittelschmerz):** Some feel mild cramps or discomfort on one side of the lower abdomen during ovulation.\n4. **Breast Tenderness:** Hormonal changes around ovulation can cause your breasts to feel sore or tender.\n5. **Increased Sex Drive:** Many people notice a higher libido as ovulation approaches due to hormone changes.\n6. **Cervical Changes:** During ovulation, the cervix becomes softer, higher, and more open.\n7. **Spotting or Discharge:** Hormonal surges may lead to light spotting or brown discharge.\n8. **[Bloating](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/bloating-during-ovulation):** Hormonal shifts can cause bloating or water retention around ovulation.\n\nThese signs, combined with ovulation tests, can give you a fuller understanding of your cycle.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Docus AI Symptom Checker\n\nJust 3 simple steps to efficiently understand and manage your health symptoms online.\n\n[Try Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker)\n\n### Use Fertility Tools\n\nConsider using apps or online calculators to track your cycle and predict ovulation. These tools can analyze your cycle patterns over time and help you pinpoint the best days for testing and trying to conceive.\n\n### Consult a Doctor\n\nIf you’ve been testing for several cycles and still don’t see positive results, it’s time to talk to a doctor. They can help figure out what might be affecting your cycle and give you advice based on your situation.\n\nIf your periods are irregular, consult a doctor right away. Ovulation tests often don’t work well with irregular cycles, so a healthcare professional can help you find better ways to track your fertility.\n\nThey may recommend an ultrasound to monitor follicle development (small sacs in the ovaries that release eggs) and better predict ovulation.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Will an ovulation test be negative if I’m pregnant?\n\nYes, ovulation tests are not designed to detect pregnancy. If you suspect pregnancy, use a pregnancy test instead.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What if I miss my period but have a positive ovulation test and a negative pregnancy test?\n\nThis could happen due to hormonal imbalances or irregular cycles. Consult a doctor to explore possible causes.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Why was my ovulation test positive one day and negative the next?\n\nThis often means you’ve caught the LH surge. Ovulation tests are most accurate during the surge, which can last a short time.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Can an ovulation test be positive in the morning and negative at night?\n\nYes, LH levels can fluctuate during the day. Testing at the same time daily improves accuracy.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What if my ovulation test is negative all month?\n\nIf your tests remain negative throughout the cycle, you might be testing at the wrong time or have irregular cycles. Consider consulting a doctor for guidance.\n\nHave more questions?

If you’re getting consistent negative tests or have irregular periods, consult a doctor for personalized advice.\n\nCombining ovulation tests with other methods can give you a clearer picture of your cycle and improve your chances of conceiving.\n\n#### Sources\n\nThis article was reviewed by leading experts in gynecology.
