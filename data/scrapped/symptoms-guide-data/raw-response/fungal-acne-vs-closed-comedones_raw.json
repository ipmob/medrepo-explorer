Fungal acne, triggered by yeast overgrowth, primarily affects the chest and back with itchy pustules. Closed comedones, or whiteheads, form from clogged pores and are common in the face's T-zone.\n\n![fungal acne vs closed comedones](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2F72278cc49a9dc3aacd5209317192219d.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\nContents\n\n- [What is Fungal Acne?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/fungal-acne-vs-closed-comedones#what-is-fungal-acne)\n- [What are Closed Comedones?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/fungal-acne-vs-closed-comedones#what-are-closed-comedones)\n- [Key Differences Between Fungal Acne and Closed Comedones](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/fungal-acne-vs-closed-comedones#key-differences-between-fungal-acne-and-closed-comedones)\n- [Treatment Options](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/fungal-acne-vs-closed-comedones#treatment-options)\n- [Conclusion](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/fungal-acne-vs-closed-comedones#conclusion)\n\n## What is Fungal Acne?\n\n### Definition and Brief Description\n\n[Fungal acne](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/fungal-acne-explained), scientifically known as _Pityrosporum folliculitis or Malassezia folliculitis_, is not acne in the traditional sense. Despite its name, it's caused by yeast and not the bacteria that typically cause acne. This condition is characterized by small, uniform pustules and papules that can often be mistaken for traditional acne.\n\n### Causes and Triggers of Fungal Acne\n\n[Fungal acne](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/fungal-acne-explained) results from an overgrowth of yeast, specifically the Malassezia species, which is naturally present on the skin. Factors that can trigger this overgrowth include:\n\n- **Excessive sweating**: Often seen in athletes or during hot and humid conditions.\n- **Tight clothing**: Clothes that trap heat and moisture against the skin can create an environment where yeast thrives.\n- **Oily skin**: Excess sebum can provide yeast with the fatty acids they need to grow.\n- **Weakened immune system**: This can make it easier for yeast to multiply unchecked.\n\n### Symptoms and Typical Areas Affected\n\n- [**Itchiness**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/itchy-acne): Unlike bacterial acne, fungal acne is typically itchy.\n- **Uniform bumps**: The pustules and papules are usually the same size and shape.\n- **Clustered outbreaks**: These often appear on the [chest](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/understanding-chest-acne), [back](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/fungal-acne-across-body), and [shoulders](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/combatting-shoulder-acne), areas where sweat and heat can accumulate.\n\n## What are Closed Comedones?\n\n### Definition and Brief Description\n\nClosed comedones, more commonly known as **whiteheads**, are a type of acne that forms when pores are _blocked by a combination of sebum, keratin, and skin debris_. This blockage occurs beneath the surface of the skin, covering the pore and preventing air from reaching the trapped matter, which distinguishes them from their counterpart, open comedones (blackheads).\n\n### Causes\n\nClosed comedones are primarily caused by:\n\n- **Hormonal changes**: Increases in androgens can stimulate excess sebum production.\n- **Improper skincare**: Using heavy, comedogenic products can block pores.\n- **Environmental factors**: Pollution and humidity can contribute to the blocking of pores.\n\n### Symptoms and Common Locations on the Body\n\n- **Small, flesh-colored bumps**: These bumps are not inflamed and are typically found in areas with dense sebaceous glands, like the forehead, cheeks, and chin.\n\n## Key Differences Between Fungal Acne and Closed Comedones\n\n| Feature | Fungal Acne | Closed Comedones |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Appearance | Small, uniform, itchy pustules | Small, non-itchy, flesh-colored bumps |\n| Causes | Yeast overgrowth,<br> often triggered by heat and humidity | Blocked pores due to sebum<br> and skin cell accumulation |\n| Common Areas | Chest, back, shoulders<br> (sweat-prone areas) | Forehead, cheeks, chin<br> (oil-prone areas) |\n| Symptoms | Itchiness and clustered outbreaks | Non-inflamed bumps that may become inflamed if irritated |\n\nFor a more in-depth understanding of your symptoms and to explore potential conditions, consider using an online tool like a [Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker) as a preliminary step before consulting a healthcare provider.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Docus AI Symptom Checker\n\nJust 3 simple steps to efficiently understand and manage your health symptoms online.\n\n[Try Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker)\n\n## Treatment Options\n\n### Treatment Strategies for Fungal Acne\n\n- **Topical Antifungals**: Medications such as ketoconazole or clotrimazole cream are commonly prescribed to reduce yeast growth.\n- **Oral Antifungals**: For severe cases, oral medications might be necessary to help control the condition.\n- **Specialized Shampoos**: Using antifungal shampoos as body washes can help treat fungal acne on the body.\n- **Lifestyle Adjustments**: Changes like wearing loose clothing and maintaining good hygiene can help manage and prevent outbreaks.\n- **Skincare Routine**: Establish a routine that includes gentle cleansing, appropriate moisturizing, and regular exfoliation with products suited to your skin type to prevent pore clogging.\n\nMaintaining a healthy skin microbiome is essential for preventing fungal acne. The PubMed [research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30085463/) indicates that yeast may be found on the skin of 75-98% of healthy individuals. While it is a normal part of the skin's flora, imbalance can lead to fungal acne.\n\nImplementing a skincare routine that includes products with probiotics or those designed to balance the skin's pH can help maintain a healthy microbiome, preventing overgrowth of yeast.\n\n### Treatment Strategies for Closed Comedones\n\n- **Topical Retinoids**: These help increase cell turnover, preventing pore blockage.\n- **Chemical Peels**: Professional treatments that help clear pores and reduce the appearance of skin bumps.\n- **Manual Extraction**: Performed by a dermatologist, this can remove closed comedones effectively.\n- **Consistent Skincare Routine**: Using non-comedogenic products to minimize further skin congestion.\n\n### Latest Advancements and Home Remedies\n\n- **Advancements in Laser Treatments**: New laser technologies can help treat resistant cases of both conditions by targeting the deeper layers of skin.\n- **Home Remedies**: Natural solutions like tea tree oil (for its antifungal properties) or apple cider vinegar (for its acidity that helps clear pores) can be supplementary treatments.\n- **Balanced Diet**: Eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains can support skin health. Avoid excessive sugar and processed foods, which can exacerbate acne.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# How do I distinguish between fungal acne and closed comedones?\n\nUnderstanding the differences is crucial for effective treatment. Fungal acne typically presents as uniform, itchy, red pustules, often on the chest and back, while closed comedones appear as small, flesh-colored bumps, primarily on the face's T-zone.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What are the main differences in appearance between fungal acne and closed comedones?\n\nFungal acne is characterized by clusters of small, red, itchy bumps. In contrast, closed comedones are non-itchy, flesh-colored bumps that do not have a head or pus.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What exactly are closed comedones, and why do they form?\n\nClosed comedones, or whiteheads, are formed when pores are clogged with sebum and dead skin cells, creating small, flesh-colored bumps on the skin.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What are the most effective treatments for fungal acne?\n\nFungal acne treatment often involves antifungal creams or shampoos containing ketoconazole or pyrithione zinc. In more severe cases, oral antifungal medication may be prescribed by a dermatologist.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# How can I effectively get rid of fungal acne?\n\nTreating fungal acne includes using antifungal medications and making lifestyle adjustments, such as changing out of sweaty clothes quickly and using non-occlusive skincare products.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What distinguishes fungal acne from other acne types?\n\nFungal acne arises from an overgrowth of yeast on the skin, leading to inflamed pustules that resemble bacterial acne but differ in cause and treatment. Unlike traditional acne, which can result from bacteria, excess oil, and dead skin cells clogging pores, fungal acne is specifically tied to yeast proliferation and requires targeted antifungal treatment.\n\nHave more questions?
