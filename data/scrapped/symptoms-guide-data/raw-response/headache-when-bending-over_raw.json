Now, if you bend over, that pressure inside your already stuffed-up sinuses builds even more, and suddenly, you feel a sharp pain in your head and face. On top of that, the inflammation can block the normal drainage of your sinuses, making the pain even worse.\n\n#### Accompanying Symptoms\n\n- Pressure or pain in the forehead, cheeks, or behind the eyes\n- Nasal congestion or a runny nose\n- Thick, discolored mucus discharge\n- [Fatigue](https://docus.ai/tags/fatigue)\n- [Fever](https://docus.ai/tags/fever)\n- Reduced sense of smell and taste\n\n#### Treatment\n\nOTC decongestants can help relieve congestion, and pain relievers can reduce headache pain. Steam inhalation and humidifiers can ease symptoms by loosening mucus. Moreover, [hydration](https://docus.ai/tags/hydration) helps to thin mucus and promote drainage.\n\nIf the sinus infection is bacterial and persists for more than a week, antibiotics may be necessary. Always consult a healthcare provider for accurate treatment.\n\n### Dehydration\n\nDehydration happens when your body loses more fluids than it takes in, which causes your blood volume to drop. When you bend over, that lower blood volume struggles to keep enough **oxygen flowing to your brain**, which can lead to a headache. On top of that, dehydration messes with your electrolyte balance, which might trigger or even make headaches worse.\n\n#### Accompanying Symptoms\n\n- Extreme thirst\n- [Dizziness](https://docus.ai/tags/dizziness) or [lightheadedness](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/dehydration-cause-vertigo), especially when standing\n- Fatigue\n- Dark-colored urine\n- Dry mouth and lips\n- Infrequent urination\n\n#### Management\n\nThe first step to treating a dehydration headache is to rehydrate. Drinking water or fluids that contain electrolytes, like sports drinks, can help get your body’s fluid levels back to normal.\n\nA water-deprivation headache usually fades within an hour or two after you drink about **16 to 32 ounces** of water, notes [Harvard Health](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/can-dehydration-cause-headaches). If you're dealing with more severe dehydration, though, you'll need to drink more fluids and take it easy—lying down for a few hours can help until the pain finally subsides.\n\nBut if you're dealing with severe dehydration—especially if you’ve got [vomiting](https://docus.ai/tags/vomiting), diarrhea, or a fever—getting medical help fast is crucial. You might need intravenous fluids in these cases.\n\n### Blood Pressure\n\nHigh [blood pressure](https://docus.ai/tags/blood-pressure) (hypertension) can lead to headaches, especially when you bend over. This happens because the extra pressure in your brain's blood vessels causes discomfort. When you change position, those blood vessels get stressed, which can bring on pain—especially when your head dips below your heart.\n\nOn the flip side, low blood pressure can make you feel dizzy or lightheaded, and that can also trigger headaches.\n\n#### Accompanying Symptoms\n\n**Of high blood pressure**:\n\n- Throbbing or pounding sensation in the head\n- Blurred or double vision\n- [Chest pain](https://docus.ai/tags/chest-pain)\n- Shortness of breath\n- [Nausea](https://docus.ai/tags/nausea)\n- Dizziness\n\n**Of low blood pressure**:\n\n- Lightheadedness or dizziness, especially when standing up\n- Fatigue or weakness\n- Blurred vision\n- Fainting\n- Nausea\n- Cold, clammy skin\n\n#### Treatment\n\nWhen it comes to high blood pressure, the first thing someone can do is manage the root of the condition. Simple lifestyle changes—like **cutting back on salt**, **losing weight**, **staying active**, and avoiding smoking or alcohol—can make a big difference in lowering your blood pressure.\n\nSometimes, though, doctors may need to prescribe medication to keep it under control. If you ever get a really bad headache along with other high blood pressure symptoms, don’t wait to get help—it could be a sign of a hypertensive crisis, and you’ll need immediate medical attention.\n\n## Can You Have a Positional Headache?\n\nA **positional headache** is a type of headache that changes in intensity based on the position of your body, particularly the head. This means that the headache can become worse or better when you change your posture—such as standing up, lying down, or bending over.\n\nThe pain may improve when you lie down or change to a less straining position.\n\nPositional headaches are more specifically related to changes in pressure within the brain or spine, such as those caused by **cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)** leak, **intracranial hypotension**, or other **structural issues** that respond directly to changes in body position.\n\nSo in these cases, your headache can indicate more serious problems. According to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/positional-headache#symptoms-and-causes), these conditions include:\n\n1. **Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS):** POTS causes an abnormal increase in heart rate when transitioning from lying down to standing or bending over. This results in dizziness, fainting, and positional headaches, which worsen with posture changes.\n2. **Spontaneous Intracranial Hypotension (SIH):** SIH occurs when there is a spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, lowering the pressure inside the skull. This leads to severe headaches that improve when lying flat and worsens when standing or bending over.\n\n**Note**: Don’t confuse this with a blood pressure headache. The main difference is that SIH headaches are caused by a leak of cerebrospinal fluid and worsen when standing or bending over, while headaches from high or low blood pressure result from abnormal pressure in blood vessels and are influenced by blood flow, often accompanied by other cardiovascular symptoms.\n3. **Cervical Spine Conditions:** Conditions affecting the cervical spine (neck), such as herniated disks, arthritis, or muscle strain, can trigger positional headaches. These conditions affect the nerves and blood vessels connected to the head, leading to pain when changing positions, especially when bending over.\n4. **Chiari Malformation:** Chiari malformation is a structural defect in which part of the brain pushes into the spinal canal, causing pressure changes that can lead to positional headaches. Bending over, standing, or other posture changes can exacerbate these headaches.\n5. **Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS):** EDS is a connective tissue disorder that can cause joint instability, including in the neck, which may lead to headaches. EDS is also associated with an increased risk of CSF leaks, which can cause positional headaches.\n6. **Tumor or Cyst on the Spine:** Tumors or cysts along the spine can interfere with the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid, causing pressure changes that lead to positional headaches. These headaches are often worse when changing posture, including bending over.\n\nIf you suspect you're experiencing a positional headache, it's important to consult a healthcare professional to identify the underlying cause and appropriate treatment options.\n\nYou can also check your symptoms in the [Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker) tool to get a better understanding of your condition prior to seeing a doctor.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Docus AI Symptom Checker\n\nJust 3 simple steps to efficiently understand and manage your health symptoms online.\n\n[Try Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker)\n\n## Diagnostic Approaches\n\nIf a headache when bending over persists or is accompanied by other symptoms like nausea, dizziness, or neurological deficits, it’s a good idea to get checked out by a doctor. The following diagnostic approaches are commonly used:\n\n- **Physical Examination and Medical History:** A doctor will start by assessing your symptoms and medical history to identify any red flags.\n- **Imaging Tests:** If a serious cause is suspected, imaging tests like MRI or CT scans can help detect structural abnormalities, such as brain tumors, Chiari malformations, or vascular issues.\n- **Sinus Imaging:** If sinusitis is suspected, your doctor might request sinus X-rays or a CT scan to assess for blockages or infections.\n- **Lumbar Puncture (Spinal Tap):** If increased intracranial pressure or a CSF leak is suspected, a lumbar puncture may be performed to measure the pressure and check for abnormalities in the spinal fluid.\n- [**Blood Tests**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview) **:** Basic blood work may help rule out infections or inflammation that could contribute to headache symptoms.\n\nEarly diagnosis can help manage both minor and severe causes of headaches effectively, so it’s essential to consult a healthcare provider if your headaches are persistent or worsening.\n\n## What to Do if You Experience a Headache from Bending Over?\n\nIf you feel a headache after bending over, try these quick steps to ease the pain:\n\n- **Sit or Lie Down**: Changing your position can help relieve pressure, especially if sinus issues or low spinal fluid are the cause.\n- **Stay Hydrated**: Drink water or an electrolyte drink, especially if dehydration might be the problem.\n- **Use a Compress**: Apply a warm compress for sinus headaches or a cold one for general relief, placing it on your forehead or neck.\n- **Take Pain Relievers**: If the headache lingers and disrupts your day, try an over-the-counter pain reliever. Just be cautious if you’re using them often—talk to a doctor if headaches are frequent.\n- **Relax and Breathe**: Stress can worsen headaches, so practice slow, deep breathing to calm down.\n\nIf your headache is severe, lasts a long time, or comes with symptoms like nausea, vision changes, or dizziness, get medical help right away. While these tips may bring temporary relief, it’s important to see a doctor if headaches from bending over keep happening.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Why do I get a headache when bending over?\n\nHeadaches when bending over can be caused by increased pressure in areas like the sinuses, decreased blood volume due to dehydration, or blood pressure fluctuations. Each of these conditions can trigger pain when the head moves into lower positions.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Why is my headache worse when I bend over?\n\nBending over increases pressure in the head, especially in the sinus cavities or blood vessels. This added pressure can worsen headaches, particularly if you have an underlying condition like a sinus infection or high blood pressure.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Why does my headache get worse when lying down or bending over?\n\nCertain conditions, like cerebrospinal fluid leaks or sinus congestion, can cause headaches that worsen when lying down or bending over. The pressure changes in these positions can trigger or exacerbate the pain.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What causes a pressure headache when bending over?\n\nA pressure headache when bending over is often linked to sinus issues or increased pressure in the brain due to high blood pressure or cerebrospinal fluid leaks. These conditions can cause pain that worsens with posture changes.\n\nHave more questions?
