There is, however, a significant connection, as individuals with autoimmune skin conditions are more likely to develop eczema.\n\n![is eczema an autoimmune disease](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2F21ec116c3ee8acabd1803a07b74f71c0.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\nContents\n\n- [What is Eczema?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/is-eczema-autoimmune-disease#what-is-eczema)\n- [Causes of Eczema](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/is-eczema-autoimmune-disease#causes-of-eczema)\n- [Is Eczema an Autoimmune Disease?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/is-eczema-autoimmune-disease#is-eczema-an-autoimmune-disease)\n- [The Link Between Eczema and Autoimmune Diseases](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/is-eczema-autoimmune-disease#the-link-between-eczema-and-autoimmune-diseases)\n- [How to Manage Eczema](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/is-eczema-autoimmune-disease#how-to-manage-eczema)\n- [Conclusion](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/is-eczema-autoimmune-disease#conclusion)\n\n## What is Eczema?\n\n[Eczema](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/eczema) is a term that encompasses a variety of inflammatory skin conditions, primarily characterized by symptoms such as itching, redness, and dryness of the skin.\n\nIt's a condition that affects millions of people worldwide. According to [StatPearls](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538209/#:~:text=The%20lifetime%20prevalence%20of%20eczema,the%20first%20year%20of%20life.), eczema affects approximately **15% to 30%** of children and **2% to 10%** of adults throughout their lifetime.\n\n### Types of Eczema\n\nThe most common form of eczema is **atopic dermatitis**, which typically begins in infancy and can continue into adulthood. This form of eczema is often associated with other allergic conditions like asthma or hay fever. Atopic dermatitis usually presents as dry, scaly patches on the skin, often on the face, hands, or the creases of elbows and knees.\n\nOther types of eczema include:\n\n- **Contact dermatitis**: This occurs when the skin reacts to direct contact with an irritant or allergen. Symptoms include redness, itching, and sometimes blisters.\n- **Dyshidrotic eczema**: Characterized by small, itchy blisters on the edges of the fingers, toes, palms, and soles of the feet. This type of eczema can be particularly uncomfortable.\n- **Nummular eczema**: Identified by circular, coin-shaped spots on the skin that can be very itchy and scaly.\n- **Seborrheic dermatitis**: Often seen in areas of the body with a lot of oil-producing (sebaceous) glands, like the scalp. It can cause dandruff and scaly patches.\n- **Stasis dermatitis**: Occurs when fluid leaks out of veins into the skin, usually in the lower legs, causing swelling, redness, and itching.\n\n### Symptoms of Eczema\n\nSymptoms of eczema can vary from person to person but generally include:\n\n- **Intense itching**: This is often the first symptom, leading to scratching that can worsen the condition.\n- **Red, inflamed skin**: The affected areas often appear red and swollen.\n- **Dryness and scaling**: The skin may become very dry, leading to scales or flakes.\n- **Blisters or weeping sores**: In some cases, blisters may form, and the skin may ooze or become crusty.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Docus AI Symptom Checker\n\nJust 3 simple steps to efficiently understand and manage your health symptoms online.\n\n[Try Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker)\n\n## Causes of Eczema\n\nEczema is a complex condition with no single known cause. Instead, it arises from a combination of genetic, environmental, and immune-related factors.\n\n### Genetic Predispositions\n\nGenetics plays a significant role in the development of eczema. People with a family history of eczema or other atopic conditions, such as **[asthma](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/asthma)** or **hay fever**, are more likely to develop the condition themselves.\n\n“ _There’s a very strong genetic component to this disease_,” [noted](https://nationaleczema.org/blog/eczema-is-not-contagious/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWhen%20someone%20has%20eczema%2C%20there,visible%20symptoms%20of%20the%20disease.) Dr. Jeff Yu, a dermatology assistant professor at Massachusetts General Hospital, “ _when someone has eczema, there is almost always a family history of the disease_.”\n\nA key genetic factor is a mutation in the **filaggrin gene**, which is essential for maintaining the skin's barrier function. When filaggrin doesn’t work properly, the skin becomes more prone to dryness and irritation, leading to the development of eczema.\n\n### Environmental Triggers\n\nThe environment is another major factor in eczema flare-ups. Common environmental triggers include:\n\n- **Allergens**: Pollen, pet dander, dust mites, and mold can trigger allergic reactions that exacerbate eczema symptoms.\n- **Irritants**: Soaps, detergents, fragrances, and certain fabrics can irritate sensitive skin, leading to flare-ups.\n- **Climate**: Dry air, extreme temperatures, and sudden changes in weather can worsen eczema by drying out the skin.\n- [**Stress**](https://docus.ai/tags/stress): Emotional stress is known to trigger or worsen eczema. The body's response to stress can lead to an increase in inflammation, which can make eczema symptoms worse.\n\n### Immune System Involvement\n\nThe immune system also plays a crucial role in eczema. While eczema is not classified as an autoimmune disease, the immune system's overreaction to external and internal triggers can cause chronic inflammation.\n\nThis inflammatory response is a key feature of eczema, leading to the characteristic symptoms of redness, itching, and swelling.\n\nHowever, unlike autoimmune diseases, where the immune system attacks the body’s own tissues, eczema primarily involves an **overactive response to environmental factors**.\n\n## Is Eczema an Autoimmune Disease?\n\nThe question of whether eczema is an autoimmune disease is a common one, given the involvement of the immune system in its symptoms. However, based on current scientific understanding, **eczema is not classified as an autoimmune disease**.\n\nTo clarify, autoimmune diseases occur when the immune system mistakenly attacks the body’s own tissues, as seen in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. In contrast, eczema involves the immune system reacting to external irritants or allergens, leading to inflammation, but not to an attack on the body itself.\n\nEczema is primarily an **inflammatory condition** rather than an autoimmune one. The immune system’s role in eczema is significant but different from its role in autoimmune diseases.\n\nIn eczema, the immune system becomes overactive and reacts strongly to substances that are generally harmless, such as certain soaps, dust mites, or stress. This overreaction leads to the chronic inflammation that characterizes eczema.\n\nTo further understand this, it’s important to differentiate between inflammation and autoimmunity. Inflammation is a natural response of the immune system to injury or infection, aimed at protecting the body. However, in eczema, this response is triggered by non-threatening substances, leading to persistent inflammation. Autoimmunity, on the other hand, involves the immune system attacking the body’s cells as if they were foreign invaders.\n\n## The Link Between Eczema and Autoimmune Diseases\n\nEczema, particularly atopic dermatitis (AD), has been found to have significant links to various autoimmune diseases.\n\nA significant population-based [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33091150/) from The British Journal of Dermatology found that individuals with one or more autoimmune conditions, particularly those affecting the skin and digestive system, had higher rates of atopic dermatitis (AD). This suggests that having one condition may increase the risk of developing the other.\n\nThis connection is important for those who suffer from eczema, as it may indicate a heightened risk of developing other conditions, and vice versa.\n\nResearch has identified several autoimmune diseases that are commonly associated with eczema. These include:\n\n- **Rheumatoid arthritis**: An autoimmune condition where the immune system attacks the joints, leading to pain, swelling, and potential joint damage.\n- **Lupus**: A complex autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organs and tissues, including the skin, joints, kidneys, and heart.\n- **Psoriasis**: A skin condition that causes red, scaly patches and is driven by an overactive immune system.\n- **Celiac disease**: An autoimmune disorder where the ingestion of gluten leads to damage in the small intestine.\n- **Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)**: Includes conditions like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, where the immune system attacks the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n## How to Manage Eczema\n\nManaging eczema effectively requires a comprehensive approach that includes a combination of medical treatments, lifestyle changes, and preventive measures. The goal is to reduce inflammation, relieve itching, and prevent flare-ups, allowing individuals to maintain healthy skin and a better quality of life.\n\nThis guide from [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/eczema/treatments-for-you) offers a comprehensive overview of eczema treatments, outlining various methods to alleviate symptoms and support skin healing:\n\n### Medical Treatments\n\n- **Corticosteroid Treatments**: These hydrocortisone-based steroids, available in creams, gels, foams, and ointments, quickly reduce itching and inflammation. They range from mild over-the-counter options for mild eczema to stronger prescriptions for severe cases. Side effects like skin thinning are rare when used correctly.\n- **PDE4 Inhibitor**: A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory applied twice daily for mild to moderate eczema, helping reduce inflammation and improve skin appearance.\n- **Barrier Repair Moisturizers**: Available over-the-counter and by prescription, these moisturizers help lock in moisture, repair skin, and relieve dryness and itching. Consult a doctor to avoid irritating ingredients.\n- **Calcineurin Inhibitors**: Alternatives to steroids, reduce inflammation when over-the-counter treatments are ineffective.\n- **Corticosteroid Pills or Injections**: Used for severe eczema, but only short-term due to risks like skin damage and bone loss.\n- **Systemic Immunomodulators**: Suppress the immune system to treat moderate-to-severe eczema when other treatments fail, but with significant side effects.\n- **Biologics**: Derived from living cells, these medications calm the immune system and ease symptoms.\n- **Antibiotics**: Prescribed to treat bacterial infections from scratching.\n- **Antihistamines**: Taken at night to reduce itching and improve sleep.\n\n### Phototherapy\n\n- **UV Light Therapy**: Involves controlled exposure to UV light (UVA, UVB, or a combination) to manage moderate-to-severe eczema. Requires careful monitoring to avoid risks like skin aging and cancer.\n- **PUVA Therapy**: Combines psoralen medication with UVA light for enhanced treatment in patients unresponsive to UV therapy alone.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nEczema is not classified as an autoimmune disease, although the immune system plays a significant role in its symptoms. Unlike autoimmune diseases, where the immune system attacks the body's own tissues, eczema involves an overreaction to external triggers, leading to chronic inflammation. Understanding this distinction is key to managing the condition effectively and finding the best treatment options for relief.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
