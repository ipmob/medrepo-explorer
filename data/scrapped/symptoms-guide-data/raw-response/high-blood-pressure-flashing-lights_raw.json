It can be confusing and even a little scary.\n\nYou might wonder: What’s causing this? Is it serious?\n\nFlashing lights in your vision can happen for different reasons. Some of these reasons are harmless, like natural changes in your eyes as you age. But other times, they can be a sign of a bigger issue.\n\nSo can high blood pressure cause flashing lights in the eyes? The answer is yes, it can.\n\n![high-blood-pressure-flashing-lights](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2Fb157f979db80220f6602c8e69615612d.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\nContents\n\n- [What is High Blood Pressure?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/high-blood-pressure-flashing-lights#what-is-high-blood-pressure)\n- [What Are Flashing Lights in the Eyes?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/high-blood-pressure-flashing-lights#what-are-flashing-lights-in-the-eyes)\n- [How Does High Blood Pressure Affect the Eyes?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/high-blood-pressure-flashing-lights#how-does-high-blood-pressure-affect-the-eyes)\n- [Can High Blood Pressure Cause Flashing Lights in the Eyes?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/high-blood-pressure-flashing-lights#can-high-blood-pressure-cause-flashing-lights-in-the-eyes)\n- [What Else Can Cause Flashing Lights In the Eyes?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/high-blood-pressure-flashing-lights#what-else-can-cause-flashing-lights-in-the-eyes)\n- [How Are High Blood Pressure Flashing Lights Diagnosed?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/high-blood-pressure-flashing-lights#how-are-high-blood-pressure-flashing-lights-diagnosed)\n- [How Are High Blood Pressure and Flashing Lights Treated?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/high-blood-pressure-flashing-lights#how-are-high-blood-pressure-and-flashing-lights-treated)\n- [Conclusion](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/high-blood-pressure-flashing-lights#conclusion)\n\n## What is High Blood Pressure?\n\nHigh blood pressure, or **hypertension**, happens when the force of your blood pushing against the blood vessel walls is too strong.\n\nThink of it like a garden hose: if the water pressure is too high, it can damage the hose over time. In your body, this pressure can harm your arteries and other vital organs.\n\nHigh blood pressure is called a \"silent killer\" because it often has no symptoms. The [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hypertension) estimates that around **1.28 billion adults** between the **ages of 30 and 79** worldwide have hypertension.\n\nOver time, it damages the blood vessels throughout your body, increasing your risk for serious health problems. For example, heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, and eye problems.\n\nA normal blood pressure is generally about 120/80 mmHg. High blood pressure starts at **130/80 mmHg or higher**.\n\n**Note:** _Blood pressure goals can vary between individuals based on age, health conditions, and medical advice._\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Your Personal AI Doctor\n\nCustomize your AI Doctor to ask any health-related questions. Get instant answers and tailored health insights.\n\n[Get Started](https://docus.ai/ai-doctor)\n\n## What Are Flashing Lights in the Eyes?\n\nFlashing lights are sudden streaks or bursts of light you see when there’s no actual light source. They’re a type of **photopsia**, a medical term for any unusual light-related visual disturbance.\n\nPhotopsia includes other effects, like zig-zag patterns or shimmering lights, which can happen during migraines.\n\nBut when people talk about \"flashing lights,\" they usually mean the quick, bright streaks often caused by changes in the retina (a light-sensitive layer at the back of your eye).\n\n![flashing-light-view](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2Fa240fe76fe7e41a10448adfc718d21b7.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## How Does High Blood Pressure Affect the Eyes?\n\nHigh blood pressure can harm your eyes by damaging the small blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients. Over time, this damage can lead to several serious conditions:\n\n- **Hypertensive Retinopathy**: High blood pressure causes the blood vessels in the retina to narrow, thicken, or leak fluid. The retina, a light-sensitive layer at the back of your eye, plays a key role in vision by converting light into signals for your brain. Damage to these vessels can result in swelling, bleeding, or reduced blood flow, impairing vision.\n- **Optic Neuropathy**: High blood pressure can reduce blood flow to the optic nerve, which connects the eye to the brain. This can lead to blurry vision or even sudden, severe vision loss.\n- **Choroidopathy**: Elevated blood pressure can cause fluid to collect under the retina, leading to swelling and distorted vision.\n\n![eye-anatomy](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2F1f0ab714835894cbd7637199da849ba1.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Can High Blood Pressure Cause Flashing Lights in the Eyes?\n\nYes, high blood pressure can cause flashing lights, typically due to hypertensive retinopathy (mentioned above). Damage to the blood vessels in the retina disrupts its normal function, which may lead to visual disturbances, including flashes of light.\n\nIn addition to flashing lights, high blood pressure can cause other symptoms in your eyes. These may include:\n\n- Blurry vision\n- Sudden vision loss\n- Double vision\n- Headaches\n\nIf you’re unsure about your symptoms, you can try using a [**Symptom Checker**](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker) tool online. However, it’s always best to consult a doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment.\n\n## What Else Can Cause Flashing Lights In the Eyes?\n\nHowever, flashing lights are not always caused by high blood pressure. Other potential causes include:\n\n- **Retinal Detachment**: When the retina pulls away from its normal position, it can create flashes of light. This is a medical emergency.\n- **Vitreous Detachment**: As the vitreous gel in the eye shrinks with age, it can tug on the retina, triggering flashes.\n- **Migraines**: Zig-zag patterns or bright flashes may occur as part of a migraine aura, even without a headache.\n- **Low Blood Pressure**: A sudden drop in blood pressure or poor circulation can lead to temporary visual disturbances, often described as \"seeing stars.\"\n\nIf you experience sudden or frequent flashing lights, don’t ignore them. Seek medical attention, especially if you also notice vision loss, [floaters](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/black-spots-in-vision-not-floaters), or a curtain blocking part of your vision. These could be signs of a serious problem like retinal detachment.\n\nHigh blood pressure may be a contributing factor and should be managed to protect your vision and health.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Docus AI Symptom Checker\n\nJust 3 simple steps to efficiently understand and manage your health symptoms online.\n\n[Try Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker)\n\n## How Are High Blood Pressure Flashing Lights Diagnosed?\n\n### Eye Exam\n\nAn eye doctor will examine your retina using a bright light tool called an **ophthalmoscope**. They check for retinal damage, swelling, or fluid leaks caused by high blood pressure. Signs of hypertensive retinopathy are also assessed.\n\n### Blood Pressure Check\n\nYour blood pressure will be measured to see if hypertension is affecting your eyes. High readings may indicate damaged blood vessels or poorly controlled blood pressure.\n\n### Other Tests\n\nAdvanced tests may include:\n\n- **Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)**: Detailed images of the retina to detect swelling, fluid buildup, or optic nerve damage.\n- **Fluorescein Angiography**: A dye highlights blood flow to check for leaks or blockages.\n- **Visual Field Test**: Detects blind spots or vision loss caused by retinal or optic nerve damage.\n\n## How Are High Blood Pressure and Flashing Lights Treated?\n\nPrevention is part of the treatment. A healthy diet, regular exercise, stress management, and avoiding smoking or alcohol can help control blood pressure and protect your eyes.\n\nIf prevention isn’t enough, medications like ACE inhibitors or diuretics may be needed to lower blood pressure. For retinal damage, treatments include **laser therapy**, **injections**, or **surgery** in severe cases. Early action is key to protecting vision and health.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Are flashing lights a symptom of stroke?\n\nFlashing lights can sometimes indicate a stroke, especially if accompanied by sudden weakness, confusion, or difficulty speaking. Seek immediate medical attention if these symptoms occur together.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# When should I be worried about flashing lights in my eyes?\n\nYou should be concerned if flashing lights are sudden, frequent, or accompanied by vision loss, floaters, or a \"curtain\" blocking part of your vision. These could signal serious conditions like retinal detachment.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Can dehydration cause flashing lights in the eyes?\n\nYes, dehydration can reduce blood flow to the retina, leading to temporary visual disturbances like flashing lights. Staying hydrated can help prevent this.\n\nHave more questions? [Ask AI Doctor](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/high-blood-pressure-flashing-lights#ask-your-question)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYes, high blood pressure can cause flashing lights in your vision. It damages the delicate blood vessels in your eyes, leading to issues like hypertensive retinopathy and other serious conditions.\n\nManaging your blood pressure through a healthy lifestyle and regular check-ups is essential to prevent long-term damage.\n\nIf you notice flashing lights or other vision changes, seek medical attention immediately.\n\n#### Sources\n\nThis article was reviewed by leading experts in cardiology and ophthalmology.
