A global study found that acne affects [20.5%](https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(24)00002-1/pdf) of people worldwide. It happens when hair follicles get clogged with oil, dead skin cells, and bacteria. This can lead to pimples, blackheads, and whiteheads. But what happens when acne starts to itch?\n\nWhen acne starts to itch, it’s often a sign of irritation or inflammation. This can happen due to various reasons such as sensitivity, product reactions, or clogged pores. If ignored, it can make the acne worse, leading to more discomfort and potential breakouts.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Your Personal AI Doctor\n\nCustomize your AI Doctor to ask any health-related questions. Get instant answers and tailored health insights.\n\n[Get Started](https://docus.ai/ai-doctor)\n\n## Why Does Acne Become Itchy?\n\nItchy acne can result from more than just clogged pores and bacteria. Several factors contribute to that uncomfortable itch:\n\n### Skin Sensitivity\n\nSome people have naturally sensitive skin, which makes acne more inflamed and itchy. Sensitive skin often reacts with itchiness, stinging, or burning when acne appears.\n\nThe skin's barrier may be weaker, allowing irritants to get through more easily. This increases inflammation and discomfort.\n\nImmediately see a doctor if the itchiness and redness become persistent, unusual, or cause any discomfort.\n\n### Environmental Factors\n\nPollution, dust, and weather changes can make acne more irritable and itchy. Research [shows](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7527424/) that air pollution can increase [**oxidative stress**](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-oxidative-stress). It leads to more inflammation and worsens acne.\n\nHot and humid climates also play a role by increasing [sebum](https://dermnetnz.org/topics/sebum) production. For every 1°C rise in temperature, sebum excretion can go up by 10%. This excess sweat and oil build-up irritates the skin, causing itchiness and making acne worse.\n\n### Product Irritation\n\nCommon acne treatments, such as benzoyl peroxide and retinoids, are popular for clearing up breakouts. However, these products can dry out the skin and cause irritation. This happens because they weaken the skin's natural moisture barrier, leading to increased sensitivity.\n\n[Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4025519/) show that these treatments are effective but often come with side effects like dryness and inflammation, which can make acne feel itchy.\n\n### Allergic Reactions\n\nIngredients in skincare or makeup can sometimes trigger allergic reactions. Common allergens include fragrances, preservatives, and certain chemicals.\n\nChemicals like [farnesol](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/702402-FARNESOL/) can activate immune cells in the skin and lead to itching and rashes. This immune response increases inflammation and can worsen acne. If your skin feels itchy after using a new product, it could be an allergic reaction making your acne worse.\n\n### Stress-Induced Itch\n\nStress not only triggers acne flare-ups but can also make your skin itch. Stress can increase itching by activating the immune and nervous systems. It releases chemicals in the skin that cause inflammation and stimulate itch sensations.\n\nStress can also weaken the skin's barrier function, making it more prone to irritation and itching. This can become a cycle—stress worsens acne and itchiness, and the discomfort increases your stress.\n\n### Friction and Sweating\n\nTight clothing, helmets, or sweat can make acne more inflamed and itchy. When friction occurs, it irritates the skin, causing redness and more breakouts. Sweat can also clog pores, worsening the irritation and itching.\n\n## Types of Acne That May Itch\n\nIf you have certain types of acne, you're more likely to experience itching and discomfort. This can help explain why your skin feels irritated and what steps you can take to manage it.\n\n![acne types](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2F4bb9ce29fd9bbb4c668d81cf44488c86.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n### Papules and Pustules\n\nPapules are **red**, **inflamed bumps without pus**, while pustules have a **white or yellow tip filled with pus**. Papules can feel sore and itchy, especially when touched or rubbed.\n\nPustules, being filled with pus, may itch as they heal or when the surrounding skin becomes irritated.\n\n### Cystic Acne\n\nCystic acne forms **deep under the skin**, resulting in **large**, **swollen**, and **often painful lumps**. It’s the most severe type of acne and can sometimes feel itchy due to the high level of inflammation. The pressure beneath the skin causes discomfort, and as the cysts heal, the surrounding skin may become itchy.\n\n### Nodular Acne\n\nNodules are **large**, **firm bumps** that form deep under the skin. They don’t usually contain pus. However, they are highly inflamed and can feel itchy, especially when the surrounding skin gets irritated by friction or pressure.\n\n### Fungal Acne\n\n[Fungal acne](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/fungal-acne-explained), also called Malassezia or Pityrosporum Folliculitis, is caused by yeast overgrowth on the skin. It appears as **small**, **itchy bumps**, usually on the chest, back, or forehead.\n\nUnlike bacterial acne, fungal acne tends to itch more because the yeast causes intense irritation to the skin.\n\n## Itchy Skin Conditions Mistaken for Acne\n\nSometimes, skin conditions that look like acne may actually be something else.\n\n- **Folliculitis** is an infection of hair follicles that creates red, itchy bumps.\n- [**Eczema**](https://docus.ai/tags/eczema) and **contact dermatitis** can also cause red, inflamed, and itchy patches that resemble acne but are due to allergies or irritants.\n- [**Rosacea**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/rosacea-vs-acne), a condition that causes redness and bumps, can be mistaken for acne but usually requires different treatments.\n\n## How to Manage and Treat Itchy Acne\n\nItchy acne can be addressed through simple home remedies, but in more severe cases, medical treatments may be necessary.\n\n### Home Remedies\n\n#### Cold Compresses\n\nApplying a cold compress can reduce inflammation and soothe itchy skin quickly. Hold it on the affected area for a few minutes to calm irritation.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe vera is great for soothing irritated skin. It has anti-inflammatory compounds that help reduce redness and itching. Aloe also helps the skin heal by boosting collagen production.\n\nPlus, it keeps the skin hydrated by locking in moisture, which can further calm irritated areas. This makes it an effective natural remedy for itchy, red skin.\n\n#### Oatmeal Masks\n\nOatmeal is known for calming irritated skin. It contains natural ingredients that reduce inflammation and itching. Oatmeal has been used for centuries to soothe conditions like eczema and dry skin.\n\nApplying an oatmeal mask can help repair the skin’s barrier and keep it moisturized, which reduces both irritation and redness. Mix oatmeal with water to make a paste and apply it to itchy areas for 10-15 minutes.\n\n#### Gentle Cleansers\n\nClean the affected area twice daily using a mild, fragrance-free cleanser. Avoid harsh soaps or scrubs that can irritate your skin and worsen the itch.\n\nMake sure to keep your hands clean and avoid touching or scratching the affected areas to prevent spreading bacteria and making acne worse.\n\n#### Moisturize Regularly\n\nUse a non-comedogenic, fragrance-free moisturizer to keep the skin hydrated. Ingredients like ceramides or hyaluronic acid can help restore the skin’s barrier.\n\n![woman acne skincare](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2Fd7e85179fcd4236e06ee24ba42371054.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n### Medical Treatments\n\n#### OTC Products\n\nOver-the-counter acne treatments can help reduce itching and inflammation. Hydrocortisone creams may help reduce itching. But they should be used sparingly on acne-prone skin due to the risk of clogging pores.\n\n#### Topical Retinoids\n\nTopical retinoids help unclog pores and reduce inflammation. They promote cell turnover and are often prescribed for more stubborn cases of acne.\n\n#### Oral Medications\n\nFor persistent or severe acne, dermatologists may prescribe oral antibiotics or oral contraceptives to reduce oil production and bacteria, addressing acne from within.\n\n#### Antifungal Treatments\n\nIf fungal acne is present, antifungal treatments like ketoconazole creams or oral fluconazole may be recommended.\n\n**Note:** _Before starting any new treatment, it's advisable to perform a patch test or consult a healthcare professional, especially if you have sensitive skin or existing skin conditions._\n\n### Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\nIt’s easy to make mistakes that can worsen the condition when treating itchy acne. Here are some common errors to watch out for:\n\n- **Over-Washing:** Washing your face too often strips away natural oils, leading to more irritation and dryness, which can make the itch worse.\n- **Harsh Exfoliation:** Scrubbing too hard can damage the skin and increase inflammation. This worsens both acne and itchiness.\n- **Ignoring Hydration:** Dehydrated skin becomes dry and flaky, which intensifies itching. Moisturizing helps maintain balance.\n- **Picking at Acne:** Picking spreads bacteria and further irritates the skin, leading to more breakouts and itch.\n- **Scratching**: Scratching acne irritates the skin further and can lead to scarring or infection.\n\n## Prevention Tips\n\nIf you have acne, it's important to take some simple steps to prevent it from becoming itchy and uncomfortable. These tips will help reduce irritation and keep your skin feeling better.\n\n- **Use Gentle Products**: Use fragrance-free, non-comedogenic skincare that won’t irritate your skin.\n- **Wear Loose Clothing**: Wear loose clothes to avoid irritation, especially when sweating.\n- **Manage Your Stress**: Reduce stress with activities like yoga, mindfulness, and good sleep to prevent flare-ups.\n- **Stay Cool and Dry**: Change clothes quickly after workouts to avoid sweat buildup that can worsen itching and acne.\n- **Use Sun Protection**: Use sunscreen to protect skin from UV damage, which can irritate acne and worsen itching.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What causes itchy acne on the jawline?\n\nItchy acne on the jawline may be related to hormonal fluctuations or skin irritation due to sweat, shaving, or cosmetics. Sometimes, fungal infections can also cause acne-like itchy bumps in this area.\n\nHave more questions? [Ask AI Doctor](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/itchy-acne#ask-your-question)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nItchy acne often happens due to common causes like sensitive skin, irritation from products, or environmental triggers like pollution or heat. Identifying these causes is the first step to finding relief.\n\nUsing gentle skincare products and soothing treatments like aloe vera can help reduce both the acne and the itch.\n\nIt’s also important to avoid common mistakes, such as overwashing or scratching. With the right care, you can ease the itching and keep your skin healthier.\n\n#### Sources\n\nThis article was written by doctors from the Docus Medical Research team and leading experts in dermatology.
