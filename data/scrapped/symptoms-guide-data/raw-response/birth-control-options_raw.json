It allows individuals to plan if and when they want children, supporting their personal and professional goals. By managing reproductive health, birth control also helps in regulating menstrual cycles and reducing the risk of certain health conditions.\n\nChoosing the right method depends on various factors, including health, lifestyle, and personal preferences.\n\n### Different Types of Birth Control\n\nBirth control methods fall into several categories:\n\n- **Hormonal Methods**: Prevent ovulation or alter the uterine environment.\n- **Barrier Methods**: Physically block sperm from reaching the egg.\n- **Natural Methods**: Track fertility signals to avoid pregnancy.\n- **Permanent Methods**: Surgical procedures for those who do not want future pregnancies.\n\nEach method has its benefits and drawbacks, and the best choice depends on individual needs.\n\n## Factors to Consider When Choosing Birth Control\n\n- **Effectiveness**: Birth control methods vary in effectiveness. Hormonal methods and IUDs are highly reliable, while barrier and natural methods are less so.\n- **Health Conditions**: Existing health issues may limit birth control options. Hormonal methods might not be suitable for everyone, making non-hormonal choices safer in some cases.\n- **Sexual Activity**: The frequency of sex and the number of partners can influence your choice. Long-term methods like IUDs offer convenience for frequent activity, while condoms are crucial for STI protection, especially with multiple partners.\n- **[STI](https://docus.ai/tags/sti) Protection**: Only condoms offer substantial protection against STIs, making them essential for those at risk.\n- **Side Effects and Risks**: Every method has potential side effects. Hormonal methods can cause changes like mood swings or [headaches](https://docus.ai/tags/headache), while barrier methods may lead to irritation.\n- **Cost and Accessibility**: Costs range from affordable options like pills to more expensive methods like IUDs. Accessibility can depend on insurance coverage and availability in your area.\n- **Reversibility and Future Plans**: Reversible methods like IUDs are ideal for those who might want children later, while permanent methods are best for those certain they do not want more children.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Docus AI Symptom Checker\n\nJust 3 simple steps to efficiently understand and manage your health symptoms online.\n\n[Try Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker)\n\n## Birth Control Options for Women\n\n### Hormonal Methods\n\n#### Oral Contraceptives (The Pill)\n\n- **How They Work**: Pills contain hormones that prevent ovulation. They also thicken cervical mucus, making it harder for sperm to reach the egg.\n- **Effectiveness**: When taken correctly, oral contraceptives are over 99% effective. But it’s easy to forget or miss pills — so in reality the pill is about 93% effective, notes [Planned Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-pill/how-effective-is-the-birth-control-pill).\n- **Pros**:\n\n  - Regulates menstrual cycles.\n  - Can reduce menstrual cramps and [acne](https://docus.ai/tags/acne).\n- **Cons**:\n\n  - Must be taken daily at the same time.\n  - Potential side effects include [nausea](https://docus.ai/tags/nausea), headaches, and mood changes.\n\n#### Contraceptive Patch\n\n- **How It Works**: A patch that releases hormones through the skin to prevent [ovulation](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/ovulation).\n- **Usage**: Worn on the skin for one week, then replaced with a new patch. This is done for three weeks, followed by a week off.\n- **Effectiveness**: Similar to oral contraceptives, with over 99% effectiveness with perfect use and around 93% with typical use, mentions [Planned Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-patch/how-effective-is-the-birth-control-patch).\n- **Pros**:\n\n  - Only needs to be replaced weekly.\n  - Easy to use and discreet.\n- **Cons**:\n\n  - Can cause skin irritation.\n  - May be less effective in women over a certain weight.\n\n#### Vaginal Ring\n\n- **How It Works**: A flexible ring inserted into the vagina, releasing hormones that prevent ovulation.\n- **Usage**: The ring stays in place for three weeks, followed by one week off.\n- **Effectiveness**: Over 99% effective with perfect use, around 93% with typical use, as per [Planned Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-vaginal-ring-nuvaring/how-effective-birth-control-ring).\n- **Pros**:\n\n  - Only needs to be replaced monthly.\n  - Lower hormone dose than pills.\n- **Cons**:\n\n  - May cause vaginal irritation or discomfort.\n  - Must be comfortable with insertion and removal.\n\n#### Birth Control Implant\n\n- **Overview**: A small rod inserted under the skin of the upper arm, releasing hormones over several years.\n- **Insertion Process**: A healthcare provider inserts the implant, which lasts up to three years.\n- **Effectiveness**: According to [Planned Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-implant-nexplanon/how-effective-is-the-birth-control-implant), 99% effective, and one of the most reliable methods.\n- **Pros**:\n\n  - Long-lasting and low maintenance.\n  - Discreet and reversible.\n- **Cons**:\n\n  - Irregular bleeding is common.\n  - Requires a minor surgical procedure for insertion and removal.\n\n#### Injectable Birth Control\n\n- **How It Works**: An injection of hormones that prevents ovulation and thickens cervical mucus.\n- **Frequency of Use**: Given every three months by a healthcare provider.\n- **Effectiveness**: Over 99% effective with perfect use, around 96% with typical use, states [Planned Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-shot/how-effective-is-the-birth-control-shot).\n- **Pros**:\n\n  - Doesn’t require daily attention.\n  - Can reduce menstrual cramps and lighten periods.\n- **Cons**:\n\n  - May cause weight gain and mood changes.\n  - Can delay the return of fertility after stopping use.\n\n#### Hormonal Intrauterine Devices (IUDs)\n\n- **Types**: Different types last between 3 to 7 years and release hormones to prevent pregnancy.\n- **Insertion Process**: Inserted by a healthcare provider during a short procedure.\n- **Effectiveness**: Nearly 99% effective, among the most reliable forms of birth control, notes [Planned Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/iud/how-effective-are-iuds).\n- **Pros**:\n\n  - Long-lasting and requires no daily action.\n  - Can lighten or stop periods.\n- **Cons**:\n\n  - Insertion can be uncomfortable.\n  - May cause spotting and cramping initially.\n\n### Non-Hormonal Methods\n\n#### Copper IUD\n\n- **How It Works**: A small, T-shaped device inserted into the uterus. The copper prevents sperm from fertilizing an egg.\n- **Insertion Process**: Placed by a healthcare provider, can last up to 10 years.\n- **Effectiveness**: Nearly 99% effective, as per [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/17741-paragard-copper-iud).\n- **Pros**:\n\n  - Hormone-free, long-lasting.\n  - Can be used as emergency contraception.\n- **Cons**:\n\n  - Can cause heavier periods and more cramping.\n  - Insertion can be uncomfortable.\n\n#### Female Condoms\n\n- **How They Work**: A plastic pouch inserted into the vagina before intercourse to block sperm.\n- **Usage**: Inserted before sex, must be used correctly every time.\n- **Effectiveness**: 95%, if used correctly, and around 79% effective with typical use, notes [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/contraception/methods-of-contraception/internal-condoms/#:~:text=Internal%20condoms%20are%20up%20to,every%20time%20you%20have%20sex.).\n- **Pros**:\n\n  - Provides protection against STIs.\n  - Can be inserted hours before intercourse.\n- **Cons**:\n\n  - Can be less comfortable than male condoms.\n  - May be more expensive and harder to find.\n\n#### Diaphragm and Cervical Cap\n\n- **Usage**: Both are inserted into the vagina to cover the cervix and block sperm. Must be used with spermicide.\n- **Fitting Process**: Requires fitting by a healthcare provider to ensure the correct size.\n- **Effectiveness**: According to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/17979-cervical-cap), it is 86% effective for individuals who have not given birth and approximately 71% effective for those who have.\n- **Pros**:\n\n  - Reusable and hormone-free.\n  - Can be inserted before intercourse.\n- **Cons**:\n\n  - Must be left in place for several hours after sex.\n  - Requires careful fitting and consistent use.\n\n#### Contraceptive Sponge\n\n- **How It Works**: A sponge soaked in spermicide, placed in the vagina to cover the cervix.\n- **Usage**: Inserted before sex, provides protection for up to 24 hours.\n- **Effectiveness**: The sponge is roughly 88% effective for women who haven't given birth, and around 80% effective for those who have, states [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24324-birth-control-sponge).\n- **Pros**:\n\n  - Easy to use, available over the counter.\n  - Provides continuous protection for multiple acts of intercourse within 24 hours.\n- **Cons**:\n\n  - Must be left in place for several hours after sex.\n  - Doesn’t protect against STIs and may increase the risk of infection.\n\n#### Spermicides\n\n- **Types**: Available as creams, gels, foams, or suppositories that kill sperm.\n- **How They Work**: Inserted into the vagina before intercourse to prevent sperm from reaching the egg.\n- **Effectiveness**: Around 70% effective when used alone, higher when combined with other methods, as per [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22493-spermicide).\n- **Pros**:\n\n  - Hormone-free and easy to use.\n  - Can be combined with other methods for added protection.\n- **Cons**:\n\n  - Must be used every time you have sex.\n  - Can cause irritation and doesn’t protect against STIs.\n\n### Permanent Methods\n\n#### Tubal Ligation\n\n- **Overview**: A surgical procedure to block or cut the fallopian tubes, preventing eggs from reaching the uterus.\n- **Procedure**: Performed by a healthcare provider, usually under general anesthesia.\n- **Effectiveness**: More than 99% effective, notes [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/sex/birth-control/tubal-ligation).\n- **Pros**:\n\n  - Permanent, no need for further contraception.\n  - Doesn’t affect hormone levels.\n- **Cons**:\n\n  - Irreversible, requires surgery.\n  - Small risk of complications from surgery.\n\n#### Salpingectomy\n\n- **How It Differs from Tubal Ligation**: Involves the complete removal of the fallopian tubes, rather than just blocking them.\n- **Effectiveness**: Nearly 100% effective, like tubal ligation, as per [John Hopkins Medicine](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/salpingectomy).\n- **Pros**:\n\n  - Eliminates the risk of ectopic pregnancy.\n  - Permanent solution.\n- **Cons**:\n\n  - Irreversible and requires surgery.\n  - Does not protect against STIs.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Your Personal AI Doctor\n\nCustomize your AI Doctor to ask any health-related questions.

While exclusive breastfeeding can delay the return of fertility, it is not a guaranteed method of contraception. Women can still ovulate and become pregnant, so it's important to use an additional form of birth control if pregnancy is not desired, notes [Lancaster Health](https://www.lancastergeneralhealth.org/health-hub-home/motherhood/the-first-year/did-you-know-you-can-get-pregnant-while-breastfeeding#:~:text=%E2%80%9CYou%20can't%20get%20pregnant,hasn't%20returned%20to%20normal.)._\n\n## Birth Control Options for Men\n\n### Barrier Methods\n\n#### Male Condoms\n\n- **Types**: Latex, polyurethane, and lambskin.\n- **Usage**: Worn over the penis during intercourse to prevent sperm from entering the vagina.\n- **Effectiveness**: Around 87% effective with typical use, as per [Planned Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/condom/how-effective-are-condoms).\n- **Pros**:\n\n  - Provides protection against STIs.\n  - Widely available and easy to use.\n- **Cons**:\n\n  - Must be used correctly every time.\n  - Can break or slip during use.\n\n#### Spermicides\n\n- **How They Work**: Used with condoms to kill sperm before they can reach the egg.\n- **Effectiveness**: 70% according to [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22493-spermicide). Increases the effectiveness of condoms when used together.\n- **Pros**:\n\n  - Adds extra protection against pregnancy.\n  - Easy to use.\n- **Cons**:\n\n  - Can cause irritation.\n  - Does not protect against STIs alone.\n\n### Permanent Methods\n\n#### Vasectomy\n\n- **Procedure**: A surgical procedure to cut or block the vas deferens, preventing sperm from mixing with semen.\n- **Effectiveness**: More than 99% effective, mentions [Better Health Channel](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/contraception-vasectomy).\n- **Reversibility**: While vasectomies are considered permanent, a reverse vasectomy is possible through another surgical procedure. However, success rates for reversing vasectomies can vary and are not guaranteed, especially the longer the time since the original procedure. [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/vasectomy-reversal/about/pac-20384537) indicates that the pregnancy rate after vasectomy reversal can vary between 30%-90%.\n- **Pros**:\n\n  - Permanent, no ongoing contraception needed.\n  - Minimal recovery time.\n- **Cons**:\n\n  - Requires surgery and is generally irreversible.\n  - Does not protect against STIs.\n\nMen have several effective birth control options, from barrier methods to permanent solutions, allowing for shared responsibility in preventing pregnancy.\n\n**Note:** _Many people consider withdrawal as a contraception method; however, it is not very effective. According to the [American Pregnancy Association](https://americanpregnancy.org/getting-pregnant/withdrawal-method-as-birth-control/), the failure rate of withdrawal is between 18% and 20%. Additionally, the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/withdrawal-method/about/pac-20395283#:~:text=Using%20the%20withdrawal%20method%20for,pre%2Dejaculation%20fluid%20contains%20sperm.) highlights that sperm can enter the vagina if withdrawal isn't timed correctly or if the pre-ejaculatory fluid contains sperm, making this method less reliable than others._\n\n## Comparing Birth Control Methods\n\n| Method | Effectiveness | STI<br> Protection |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Implants | >99% | - |\n| Hormonal IUDs | >99% | - |\n| Copper IUD | >99% | - |\n| Oral<br> Contraceptives | >93%-99% | - |\n| Contraceptive<br> Patch | 93%-99% | - |\n| Vaginal Ring | 93%-99% | - |\n| Injectable<br> Contraceptives | 96%-99% | - |\n| Male Condoms | 87%-99% | + |\n| Female Condoms | 79%-95% | + |\n| Diaphragm/<br> Cervical Cap | 71%-86% | - |\n| Spermicides | 70% | - |\n| Contraceptive<br> Sponge | 80%-88% | - |\n| Tubal Ligation | >99% | - |\n| Vasectomy | >99% | - |\n\n## How to Choose the Right Birth Control\n\n**Warning**: _Before starting any birth control method, especially the hormonal ones, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare provider. Some methods may have contraindications or interact with existing health conditions, so professional advice is essential to ensure safety and effectiveness._\n\nYour daily routine, comfort with procedures, sexual activity, and STI risk should guide your choice. Consider methods that align with your lifestyle to ensure consistency and effectiveness.\n\nCost and availability are crucial. Some methods are more affordable and easier to access than others. Check your insurance coverage and explore local clinics to find a method that fits your budget and is easy to obtain.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What is the most effective birth control method?\n\nThe most effective methods are implants, IUDs, and sterilization, with over 99% effectiveness when used correctly. These options require minimal maintenance and are ideal for those seeking long-term solutions.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Can I still get pregnant if I’m breastfeeding?\n\nYes, while breastfeeding can delay fertility, it is not a foolproof method of contraception. Pregnancy can occur if ovulation resumes, so using an additional birth control method is recommended.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Can I use hormonal birth control methods if I have a history of blood clots?\n\nHormonal birth control methods, particularly those containing estrogen, may not be suitable for individuals with a history of blood clots. It's important to consult with a healthcare provider to discuss safer alternatives that don't increase the risk of clotting.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# How do hormonal birth control methods work?\n\nHormonal methods like pills, patches, and IUDs work by preventing ovulation or altering the uterine environment to reduce the chances of pregnancy. They are highly effective but may have side effects such as mood changes or weight gain.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# How quickly can I get pregnant after stopping birth control?\n\nReversibility varies by method. Fertility generally returns quickly after stopping pills, patches, or removing IUDs. However, methods like injectables may delay the return of fertility for a few months.\n\nHave more questions?
