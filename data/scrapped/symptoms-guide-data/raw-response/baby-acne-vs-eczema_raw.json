Knowing the distinctions between baby acne and eczema is essential for providing the best care for the baby’s skin and the parents' peace of mind.\n\n![baby acne vs eczema](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2Feee6b0dc9f9e801c58c9ec996f7127f7.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\nContents\n\n- [What is Baby Acne?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/baby-acne-vs-eczema#what-is-baby-acne)\n- [What is Baby Eczema?](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/baby-acne-vs-eczema#what-is-baby-eczema)\n- [Key Differences Between Baby Acne and Eczema](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/baby-acne-vs-eczema#key-differences-between-baby-acne-and-eczema)\n- [Treatment Options](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/baby-acne-vs-eczema#treatment-options)\n- [Baby Skin Care Tips](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/baby-acne-vs-eczema#baby-skin-care-tips)\n- [Summary](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/baby-acne-vs-eczema#summary)\n\n## What is Baby Acne?\n\nBaby acne, also known as **neonatal acne**, is a common skin condition that affects newborns. It typically appears around **2 weeks of age**, but it can develop anytime before **6 weeks**. In some cases, a baby may even be born with acne.\n\nAccording to [AAD](https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/acne/really-acne/baby-acne#:~:text=About%2020%25%20of%20newborns%20have,baby%20is%20born%20with%20acne.), this condition is quite prevalent, affecting about **20% of newborns**. It is important to note that baby acne is generally harmless and temporary, **usually resolving on its own within a few months** without causing any long-term effects.\n\nWhen acne appears **after 6 weeks** of age, it is called **infantile acne**. Although less common, it may persist into early childhood.\n\n![baby acne](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2F0f785dc1caa8bea006aa0c92ccab2b6e.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n### Symptoms\n\nThe symptoms of baby acne are relatively easy to identify. It typically manifests as **small red or white pimples on the baby's face**, especially the **cheeks**, **nose**, and **forehead**. In some cases, it may also appear on the neck, back, and chest.\n\nUnlike eczema, baby acne **does not cause itchiness** or discomfort. The skin around the pimples remains smooth and is not dry or flaky.\n\nParents need to recognize these symptoms to avoid unnecessary treatments and understand that this condition usually resolves without intervention.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Docus AI Symptom Checker\n\nJust 3 simple steps to efficiently understand and manage your health symptoms online.\n\n[Try Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker)\n\n### Causes\n\nThe exact causes of baby acne are not entirely understood, but several factors are believed to contribute to its development:\n\n- **Hormonal Changes:** The transfer of maternal hormones to the baby during [pregnancy](https://docus.ai/tags/pregnancy) can stimulate the baby's oil glands, leading to the formation of pimples. After birth, the baby's own hormones, especially androgen, can continue to stimulate oil production, contributing to acne.\n- **Overactive Oil Glands:** Newborns have highly sensitive and active oil glands. These glands can produce excess oil, which can clog pores and result in acne.\n- **Genetic Factors:** A family history of acne can increase the likelihood of a baby developing neonatal or infantile acne.\n\n## What is Baby Eczema?\n\nBaby eczema is a chronic skin condition that causes **dry**, **itchy**, and **inflamed skin**.\n\nIt is a type of dermatitis that can appear as early as **6 months** of age and is more prevalent among children with a family history of [allergies](https://docus.ai/tags/allergy) or [asthma](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/asthma).\n\nAlso, according to Medscape [data](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/911574-overview?form=fpf), the likelihood of children developing atopic dermatitis is **60%** if one parent is affected, and it increases to nearly **80%** if both parents have the condition.\n\nThere are several types of baby eczema:\n\n- Atopic dermatitis\n- Seborrheic dermatitis (cradle cap)\n- Contact dermatitis\n\n![Baby eczema](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2F85a1ab2507845709ea4bec80e9d8c2b8.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n### Symptoms\n\nCommon symptoms of baby eczema include:\n\n- **Dry**, **itchy** skin\n- **Red** or inflamed patches\n- **Scaly** and **rough** skin\n- **Oozing** or crusty lesions\n- **Thickened** skin over time\n\nAffected areas typically include the **cheeks**, **forehead**, and **scalp** in infants, but eczema can also spread to the knees, elbows, and other parts of the body as the baby grows.\n\nThese symptoms can cause significant discomfort for the baby, leading to scratching and potential skin infections.\n\nThe itchy nature and scaly appearance of baby eczema can help differentiate it from other skin conditions like baby acne.\n\n### Causes\n\nThe causes of baby eczema are multifaceted, involving a combination of genetic and environmental factors:\n\n- **Genetic Factors:** Babies with a family history of eczema, asthma, or hay fever are more likely to develop eczema.\n- **Skin Barrier Issues:** A deficiency in filaggrin, a protein that helps form the skin barrier, can lead to increased moisture loss and reduced protection against irritants and allergens. This weakens the skin's ability to retain moisture and protect itself from environmental factors.\n- **Environmental Triggers:** Exposure to allergens, such as pet dander, pollen, or dust mites, can trigger eczema flare-ups. Irritants like harsh soaps, detergents, and synthetic fabrics can also aggravate the condition.\n- **Climate:** Extremes in temperature and humidity can exacerbate eczema symptoms. Dry, cold air can strip the skin of moisture, while hot, humid conditions can increase sweating, which may irritate the skin.\n\nUnderstanding these causes can help manage baby eczema by avoiding known triggers and using appropriate skincare routines to strengthen the skin barrier.\n\n## Key Differences Between Baby Acne and Eczema\n\nRecognizing the distinct differences between baby acne and eczema is crucial for parents and caregivers to ensure appropriate skin care for their infants. Here's an in-depth look at how these two conditions differ:\n\n| Feature | Baby Acne | Baby Eczema |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Appearance | Small pimples<br> Red or white spots | Dry, scaly patches<br> Red or dark areas |\n| Itchiness | Not itchy | Very itchy |\n| Affected Areas | Face<br> Neck<br> Chest<br> Back | Face<br> Arms<br> Legs<br> Elbows<br> Knees |\n| Age of Onset | 2-6 weeks | 6 months-5 years |\n| Duration | Resolves within a few months | Can persist and recur |\n| Causes | Hormones<br> Overactive oil glands | Genetic factors<br> Skin barrier issues |\n| Fluid Leakage | No | Yes |\n\nBy understanding these key differences, parents and caregivers can better identify whether their baby is dealing with acne or eczema, ensuring they seek appropriate care and treatment.\n\nAs a first step, parents can use the [Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker/child-symptom-checker) to help identify and understand their baby's symptoms before consulting a healthcare provider. Remember, online tools are not a substitute for professional medical advice.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Docus AI Symptom Checker\n\nJust 3 simple steps to efficiently understand and manage your health symptoms online.\n\n[Try Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker)\n\n## Treatment Options\n\n### Treatment for Baby Acne\n\nWhen it comes to baby acne, the good news is that it usually resolves on its own without the need for medical treatment.\n\nHowever, several home care tips from the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/baby-acne/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20369885) can help manage the condition and prevent irritation:\n\n- **Clean Daily:** Wash the baby's face daily with warm water. Alternate between using plain water one day and water with a mild, moisturizing facial soap the next.\n- **Dry Gently:** Pat the baby's skin dry. Avoid rubbing to prevent irritation.\n- **Avoid Scrubbing:** Do not scrub the baby's skin. Be gentle to avoid irritation.\n- **Refrain from Using Lotions:** Avoid using lotions, ointments, or oils. These products can make baby acne worse.\n\n**Note**: _Avoid applying acne medicine or acne wash to the baby's skin unless recommended by a dermatologist or pediatrician_\n\n### Treatment for Baby Eczema\n\nTreating baby eczema requires a more proactive approach, as the condition can cause significant discomfort and is prone to flare-ups. While there is no cure for eczema, various treatments can help manage and alleviate symptoms.\n\nAccording to the [AAD](https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/eczema/childhood/treating/treat-babies), tips for managing baby eczema could include:\n\n- **Mastering the Bathing Technique:** Bathing is essential for removing dirt and potential irritants from the baby's skin. Use lukewarm water and a mild, fragrance-free cleanser to wash only the dirty or smelly parts. Avoid scrubbing and keep baths between five to 10 minutes. Immediately after the bath, apply a fragrance-free moisturizer. Thick creams and ointments are generally more effective than lotions or oils. Moisturize the baby's skin twice a day or as often as needed for relief.\n- **Using Topical Corticosteroids:** These medications help reduce inflammation and itching. Available in forms like ointments, creams, sprays, and lotions, it's important to work with a dermatologist to find the best option. Apply the corticosteroid immediately after the bath before using a moisturizer. Follow the dermatologist's directions on the amount, duration, and frequency of treatment to avoid side effects, as babies are more sensitive to corticosteroids than adults.\n- **Identifying and Eliminating Triggers:** Everyday triggers can cause eczema to appear or worsen. Common triggers include sweat, saliva, scratching, tobacco smoke, dry air, pet dander, pollen, and certain products like clothing, laundry detergents, fabric softeners, shampoos, soaps, baby powder, or wipes. Identifying and avoiding these triggers can help manage eczema. For instance, applying plain petroleum jelly around the mouth before feedings and naps can help if saliva triggers facial eczema.\n\n**Note**: _It's crucial to start treating a child's eczema as soon as it's noticed to prevent the condition from worsening and becoming more challenging to treat._\n\n## Baby Skin Care Tips\n\nProper skin care is essential for keeping your baby's skin healthy and comfortable. Here are some practical tips to follow:\n\n- **Nail Care:** Keep the baby’s nails trimmed and smooth to prevent scratching and further skin damage.\n- **Hydration:** Ensure the baby is well-hydrated by giving them plenty of fluids.\n- **Comfortable Clothing:** Dress the baby in loose, comfortable clothing to avoid irritation from tight or rough fabrics.\n- **Sun Protection:** Protect the baby’s skin from excessive sun exposure by using appropriate clothing and shade. Avoid direct sunlight and use baby-safe sunscreen if needed.\n- **Temperature Control:** Maintain a comfortable room temperature and avoid overheating the baby. Use a humidifier in dry weather to keep the air moist.\n- **Moisturizing:** Apply a thick, fragrance-free moisturizer to the baby's skin at least twice a day to lock in moisture.\n- **Avoid Irritants:** Use hypoallergenic laundry detergents and avoid products with strong fragrances or harsh chemicals.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# How can you tell the difference between baby acne and eczema?\n\nBaby acne typically appears as small red or white pimples on the face and does not itch, while eczema presents as dry, itchy, and scaly patches that can appear anywhere on the body.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# At what age does baby acne usually develop?\n\nBaby acne often develops around two weeks of age but can appear anytime before six weeks.
