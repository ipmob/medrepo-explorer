The body filters it out of the blood through the kidneys, and it is excreted in the urine. Measuring creatinine levels can provide insight into how well the kidneys are functioning. Healthy kidneys filter creatinine out efficiently, while **high levels can indicate that the kidneys are not working properly**.\n\n### Normal Creatinine Levels\n\nNormal creatinine levels vary depending on age, gender, and muscle mass. Generally, lower levels indicate normal kidney function, while higher levels may suggest impaired function.\n\nAccording to the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/creatinine-test/about/pac-20384646#:~:text=The%20typical%20range%20for%20serum,52.2%20to%2091.9%20micromoles%2FL)), the typical range for creatinine is:\n\n- **For adult men**: 0.74 to 1.35 mg/dL (65.4 to 119.3 micromoles/L).\n- **For adult women**: 0.59 to 1.04 mg/dL (52.2 to 91.9 micromoles/L).\n\n**Note**: _Different labs have slightly different guidelines, so it’s important to refer to the specific reference range provided by the lab conducting the test._\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## Role of Fruits in Managing Creatinine Levels\n\nFruits are particularly beneficial for kidney health due to their rich nutritional profile.
