High or low albumin levels can indicate dehydration, liver or kidney disease, and other health issues, making early diagnosis and management crucial.\n\nContents\n\n- [What Is Albumin?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/albumin#what-is-albumin)\n- [When Is Albumin Testing Recommended?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/albumin#when-is-albumin-testing-recommended)\n- [How Is Albumin Testing Conducted?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/albumin#how-is-albumin-testing-conducted)\n- [What Are the Normal Albumin Levels?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/albumin#what-are-the-normal-albumin-levels)\n- [What Do Abnormal Levels Mean?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/albumin#what-do-abnormal-levels-mean)\n\n## What Is Albumin?\n\nAlbumin is a type of **protein** that is found in your blood and other body fluids. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the right balance of fluids in your body and transporting important substances like hormones, vitamins, and medications.\n\nDoctors often measure albumin levels to check for problems related to the liver, kidneys, or other conditions. This biomarker can help identify dehydration, inflammation, and other diseases.\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## When Is Albumin Testing Recommended?\n\nAlbumin testing is often used to diagnose or monitor a variety of health conditions. It provides useful information about your overall health and can be ordered as part of routine check-ups or when you have specific symptoms. Here are some common reasons for testing:\n\n- Routine health check-ups and preventive screenings\n- [Abdominal pain](https://docus.ai/tags/abdominal-pain), especially on the right side\n- Changes in urine or stool color\n- Yellowing of the skin (jaundice)\n- Unexplained [weight loss](https://docus.ai/tags/weight-loss)\n- Persistent diarrhea or [vomiting](https://docus.ai/tags/vomiting)\n- Swelling in different parts of the body\n- Fluid build-up in the abdomen\n- Itchy skin\n\n## How Is Albumin Testing Conducted?\n\nAlbumin levels are usually measured through a blood test, but in some cases, urine or other body fluids like cerebrospinal fluid can be tested. The most common tests that include albumin measurements are:\n\n- [**Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/metabolic-panel#types-of-metabolic-panels-bmp-and-cmp) – checks overall organ function, including albumin levels.\n- **Liver Function Tests (LFTs)** – measures albumin to assess liver health.\n\n**Preparation for the Test:**\n\nNo special preparations are usually required for an albumin blood test. However, it is a good idea to inform your doctor of any medications or supplements you’re taking, as these can sometimes affect the results.\n\n## What Are the Normal Albumin Levels?\n\n- **Adults:** 45–50 g/L\n- **Children under 1 year:** 35–50 g/L\n- **Pregnant women:**\n  - **Trimester I:** 31–51 g/L\n  - **Trimester II:** 26–45 g/L\n  - **Trimester III:** 23–42 g/L\n\n**Note** _: The units of measurement and the normal ranges can differ depending on the laboratory and the specific methods used._\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## What Do Abnormal Levels Mean?\n\n### Albumin High Levels\n\nHigh albumin levels can indicate various health issues. Some possible causes include:\n\n- **Dehydration:** When your body loses too much water, albumin levels can rise.\n- **Prolonged fasting:** Not eating for a long time can cause changes in protein levels.\n- **Metabolic disorders:** These are conditions that affect how your body processes energy.\n- **Inflammatory diseases:** Certain conditions like [arthritis](https://docus.ai/tags/arthritis) can cause inflammation, affecting albumin levels.\n- [**Thyroid problems**](https://docus.ai/tags/thyroid-issues) **:** An overactive thyroid can lead to higher levels of albumin.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\n- Drink enough fluids to stay hydrated.\n- Maintain a balanced diet with sufficient protein.\n- Manage underlying conditions such as thyroid disorders or inflammation through regular medical care.\n\n### Albumin Low Levels\n\nLow albumin levels can also signal health problems. Here are some common causes:\n\n- **Liver disease:** The liver produces albumin, so problems with liver function can lower levels.\n- [**Kidney disease**](https://docus.ai/tags/kidney-diseases) **:** When the kidneys don’t work properly, albumin can be lost through urine.\n- **Blood loss:** Losing a lot of blood can reduce albumin levels.\n- **[Vitamin C deficiency](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/vitamin-c):** A lack of certain vitamins, especially Vitamin C, can affect protein levels.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\n- Follow a liver-friendly diet if you have liver issues.\n- Consult a doctor about managing kidney conditions.\n- Eat a diet rich in vitamins and nutrients.\n- Seek treatment for blood loss if needed.\n\n### Which Specialist Should You Consult?\n\nIf your albumin levels are too high or too low, you should consult a **general practitioner**. They will assess your symptoms and may refer you to specialists, such as a **hepatologist** (for liver issues) or a **nephrologist** (for kidney-related problems), depending on the results of your test.\n\n#### Sources\n\nThis article was reviewed by leading nephrology experts.
