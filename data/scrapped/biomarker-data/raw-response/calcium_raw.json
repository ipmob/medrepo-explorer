It is essential for maintaining **strong bones** and **teeth**, but its role extends far beyond that.\n\nCalcium is involved in **muscle contractions**, **nerve function**, **blood clotting**, and the **release of certain hormones**. It also helps regulate other minerals, like **[phosphorus](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/phosphorus)** and **magnesium**, to keep the body in balance.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Your Personal AI Doctor\n\nCustomize your AI Doctor to ask any health-related questions. Get instant answers and tailored health insights.\n\n[Get Started](https://docus.ai/ai-doctor)\n\n## When Is Calcium Testing Recommended?\n\nCalcium testing is typically included in [metabolic panels](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/metabolic-panel) but can also be ordered individually if specific symptoms or conditions are present. A doctor may recommend a calcium test in the following situations:\n\n- **Signs of Nervous System Issues**: Such as muscle cramps, tingling, or abnormal reflexes, which might indicate abnormal calcium levels.\n- **Bone Health Problems**: If there are signs of weakened bones, pathological fractures, or conditions like osteoporosis.\n- [**Kidney Issues**](https://docus.ai/tags/kidney-diseases): To monitor kidney function or identify kidney stones, which can be influenced by calcium levels.\n- **Recurrent Muscle Spasms or Convulsions**: This can be a sign of disrupted calcium levels affecting muscle function.\n- **Monitoring Chronic Conditions**: Such as parathyroid gland disorders, which directly affect calcium regulation in the body.\n- **Suspected Vitamin D Deficiency**: Since calcium absorption is closely linked to [vitamin D levels](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/vitamin-d), testing may be needed to assess the overall balance.\n\n## How Is Calcium Testing Conducted?\n\nCalcium testing is most commonly conducted through a [**blood test**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview), specifically using a venous blood sample.\n\nIt is often included as part of larger panels such as the **Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)** or the **Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP)**, which provide a broader view of electrolyte and mineral balance in the body. Sometimes, doctors may order a specific \"serum calcium test\" to focus on calcium levels alone.\n\n### Testing Process\n\n- **Sample Collection**: A healthcare professional draws a blood sample from a vein, usually from the arm.\n- **Preparation**: Fasting overnight is often recommended before the test to ensure accurate results, as recent food intake can influence calcium levels.\n- **Laboratory Analysis**: The sample is analyzed using an automated colorimetric technique, which measures the concentration of calcium in the blood and expresses the result in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or millimoles per liter (mmol/L).\n\n### Other Testing Methods\n\n- **Ionized Calcium Test**: This measures the free calcium in the blood, providing more specific information when total calcium levels are abnormal.\n- **Urine Calcium Test**: In certain cases, a doctor may prescribe a **24-hour** urine calcium test, especially if kidney stones, calcium metabolism issues, or abnormal blood calcium levels are a concern. This test measures the amount of calcium excreted in the urine over a full day, providing insight into how the body processes and eliminates calcium. High levels in urine can suggest a risk of kidney stones or indicate hyperparathyroidism, while low levels may point to dietary deficiencies or malabsorption.\n\nSpecial preparations, such as avoiding certain supplements or medications before the test, may be required based on your doctor's advice to ensure the most accurate results.\n\n## What Are the Normal Calcium Levels?\n\nThe reference ranges can vary depending on age, but generally, the following ranges are considered normal for **blood tests:**\n\n- **Children (Up to 17 years old)**: 8.8-10.8 mg/dL\n- **Adults (18-59 years old)**: 9.0-10.0 mg/dL\n\n**Normal Urine Calcium Ranges**:\n\nFor individuals on a normal calcium diet, the expected calcium level in a 24-hour urine test is typically between **100 to 300 milligrams per day (mg/day)**, or **2.50 to 7.50 millimoles** per 24 hours (mmol/24 hours).\n\nFor those on a low-calcium diet, the normal range is lower, generally **50 to 150 mg/day** or **1.25 to 3.75 mmol/24 hours**. These ranges help healthcare providers interpret results within the context of dietary intake, ensuring an accurate assessment of calcium metabolism.\n\n**Note**: _The units of measurement and the normal ranges can differ depending on the laboratory and the specific methods used._\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## What Do Abnormal Calcium Levels Mean?\n\nAbnormal calcium levels can indicate various underlying health conditions, making it important to understand what might cause these deviations. Calcium levels can be either higher or lower than the normal range, each pointing to different potential issues.\n\n### High Calcium Levels\n\nElevated calcium levels, known as hypercalcemia, may suggest underlying health conditions or imbalances in the body. Common causes of high calcium levels include:\n\n- **Overactive Parathyroid Glands**: When the parathyroid glands produce too much hormone, it can increase calcium levels.\n- **Vitamin D Toxicity**: Excessive vitamin D can lead to increased calcium absorption in the intestines.\n- **Chronic Kidney Issues**: Impaired kidney function can cause calcium levels to rise due to reduced excretion.\n- **Certain Cancers**: Some types of cancer, like those affecting the bones, can release calcium into the bloodstream.\n- **Prolonged Immobility**: Being immobile for long periods can cause bone calcium to release into the blood.\n- **Milk-Alkali Syndrome**: Overconsumption of calcium-rich supplements or antacids can lead to a condition called Burnett's syndrome, increasing blood calcium.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\n- Work closely with your doctor to determine the exact cause of high calcium levels.\n- Check [parathyroid hormone](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/parathyroid-hormone) levels, as they are often related to calcium balance.\n- Follow a balanced diet that limits excessive calcium intake while ensuring other nutrients are adequate.\n- Stay hydrated to help maintain proper kidney function.\n\n### Low Calcium Levels\n\nLow calcium levels, known as hypocalcemia, can also point to various health concerns. It is essential to identify the underlying causes for proper treatment. Common causes include:\n\n- **Vitamin D Deficiency**: Without enough vitamin D, the body cannot absorb calcium effectively from food.\n- **Low Protein Levels**: Since much of the calcium in the blood is bound to protein, low protein levels can reduce calcium availability.\n- **Parathyroid Gland Dysfunction**: When the glands do not produce enough hormones, calcium levels can drop.\n- **Pancreatitis**: Inflammation of the pancreas can cause calcium to deposit in tissues, lowering blood calcium.\n- **Certain Digestive Disorders**: Conditions like celiac disease or Crohn's disease can impair calcium absorption in the intestines.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\n- Consult your healthcare provider to identify the root cause of low calcium levels.\n- Include calcium-rich foods in your diet, such as leafy greens, almonds, and dairy products.\n- Discuss with your doctor whether you need to monitor other electrolyte levels, like [magnesium](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/magnesium), which can also impact calcium balance.\n- Ensure you get adequate vitamin D through sunlight, diet, or supplements as advised by your doctor.\n\n### Which Specialist Should You Consult?\n\nIf your calcium levels are abnormal, it's important to seek advice from a healthcare professional who can guide further testing and management. You may need to consult:\n\n- **Endocrinologist**: A specialist in hormone-related conditions, including issues with the parathyroid glands.\n- **Nephrologist**: A kidney specialist, especially if the abnormal calcium levels are related to kidney function.\n- **General Practitioner**: For initial evaluation and referrals to a specialist if more in-depth care is needed.\n\n#### Sources\n\nThis article was written by doctors from the Docus Medical Research team and reviewed by leading endocrinology and nephrology experts.
