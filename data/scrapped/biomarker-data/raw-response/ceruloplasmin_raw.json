Most of the copper in your blood is attached to **ceruloplasmin**.\n\nDoctors check ceruloplasmin levels to look for problems with how your body uses copper.\n\nFor example, in a condition called **Wilson’s disease**, copper builds up in organs like the liver and brain. That causes serious health issues.\n\nMeasuring ceruloplasmin can help doctors find and treat such problems early.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Your Personal AI Doctor\n\nCustomize your AI Doctor to ask any health-related questions. Get instant answers and tailored health insights.\n\n[Get Started](https://docus.ai/ai-doctor)\n\n## When Is Ceruloplasmin Testing Recommended?\n\nDoctors may recommend ceruloplasmin testing to investigate symptoms or conditions related to copper metabolism or deficiency.\n\nTesting is often prescribed for individuals with unexplained symptoms or as part of a broader diagnostic panel.\n\nTesting may be prescribed for:\n\n- **Wilson’s Disease Symptoms**:\n\n\n  - [Anemia](https://docus.ai/tags/anemia)\n  - Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)\n  - Nausea or abdominal pain\n  - Tremors or trouble walking\n  - Behavioral changes\n- **Copper Deficiency Concerns**: Conditions that may lead to inadequate copper absorption.\n- **Liver Disease Symptoms**: Jaundice, swelling, or abnormal liver enzyme levels.\n- **Neurological Issues**: Unexplained tremors, movement disorders, or speech difficulties.\n\n## How Is Ceruloplasmin Testing Conducted?\n\nCeruloplasmin levels are measured using a [blood test](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview). A small sample of venous blood is collected, usually from the arm, and sent to a laboratory for analysis.\n\nThis test does not typically require fasting unless combined with other blood tests that do. Inform your doctor about any medications, supplements, or contraceptives you’re using, as these can influence ceruloplasmin levels. Testing is often scheduled in the morning for consistency.\n\n## What Are the Normal Ceruloplasmin Levels?\n\nThe normal range for a ceruloplasmin serum test in adults is typically between **20 to 35** milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL).\n\n**Note**: _The exact range can vary depending on factors such as sex, age, units of measurement, the laboratory, and the methods used for testing_\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## What Do Abnormal Levels Mean?\n\n### Ceruloplasmin High Levels\n\nElevated ceruloplasmin levels can indicate various health conditions. High levels typically suggest inflammation, tissue damage, or copper imbalances.\n\n**Causes of High Levels**\n\n- **Liver Disease**: Chronic or acute liver damage increases ceruloplasmin levels.\n- **Cardiovascular Diseases**: Heart-related conditions may elevate levels due to systemic inflammation.\n- [**Autoimmune Diseases**](https://docus.ai/tags/autoimmune-diseases): Conditions like lupus can trigger high levels.\n- **Infectious Diseases**: Infections often raise ceruloplasmin as part of the body’s immune response.\n- **Pregnancy**: Normal hormonal changes during pregnancy naturally increase levels.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\n- Follow a balanced diet rich in anti-inflammatory foods.\n- Consult a healthcare provider for a complete diagnosis.\n- Avoid excessive supplementation unless prescribed.\n- Manage chronic conditions, such as diabetes or autoimmune disorders, with professional guidance.\n\n### Ceruloplasmin Low Levels\n\nLow ceruloplasmin levels can point to nutritional deficiencies or disorders that impair copper absorption or metabolism.\n\n**Causes of Low Levels**\n\n- **Malnutrition**: Insufficient dietary copper intake reduces ceruloplasmin production.\n- **Wilson’s Disease**: Copper accumulates in organs instead of being properly utilized.\n- **Menkes Disease**: A rare genetic condition affecting copper metabolism.\n- [**Kidney Disease**](https://docus.ai/tags/kidney-diseases): Conditions like nephrotic syndrome can lower levels.\n- [**Liver Disease**](https://docus.ai/tags/liver): Advanced liver dysfunction may impair ceruloplasmin synthesis.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\n- Include copper-rich foods in your diet, such as nuts, seeds, and shellfish.\n- Seek specialized care for underlying conditions like Wilson’s disease.\n- Avoid over-supplementing copper without medical advice.\n- Maintain regular check-ups to monitor progress.\n\n### Which Specialist Should You Consult?\n\nDepending on the suspected underlying cause of abnormal ceruloplasmin levels, you may need to consult one or more specialists:\n\n- **General Practitioner**: For initial evaluation and test recommendations.\n- **Hematologist**: For blood-related abnormalities and conditions.\n- **Hepatologist**: For liver diseases and copper metabolism issues.\n- **Neurologist**: For neurological symptoms like tremors or movement disorders.\n- **Rheumatologist**: For autoimmune conditions linked to abnormal levels.\n\nIf you suspect any symptoms related to ceruloplasmin imbalances, consult a healthcare professional promptly for diagnosis and tailored treatment options.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Does ceruloplasmin carry iron?\n\nNo, ceruloplasmin does not carry iron. Instead, it helps regulate iron metabolism by oxidizing iron into a form that can be transported in the blood.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What disease is low copper?\n\nLow copper levels are often associated with Wilson's disease, a condition where copper builds up in the liver and other organs. Another condition is Menkes disease, a rare genetic disorder that affects copper absorption and distribution in the body.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Can ceruloplasmin levels vary during pregnancy?\n\nYes, ceruloplasmin levels naturally increase during pregnancy due to hormonal changes, especially in the second and third trimesters.\n\nHave more questions?
