Its main function is to **stimulate the production of** [**red blood cells**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/red-blood-cell-rbc) **in the bone marrow**, which are responsible for carrying oxygen to the body’s tissues. This process is crucial for maintaining healthy oxygen levels and ensuring the proper functioning of vital organs.\n\nWhen the body senses a shortage of oxygen, such as during high altitudes or in cases of anemia, the kidneys produce more EPO to boost red blood cell production and restore oxygen balance.\n\nErythropoietin is also a key biomarker used in diagnosing and managing various health conditions. Measuring EPO levels can help determine the cause of anemia, evaluate kidney function, and identify other medical conditions affecting red blood cell production.\n\n## When Is Erythropoietin Testing Recommended?\n\nEPO testing is typically recommended when a doctor suspects an imbalance in red blood cell production, which could be due to several health conditions. Below are common scenarios when EPO testing may be ordered:\n\n- **To differentiate between types of anemia**: Especially after initial blood tests suggest the presence of anemia, EPO testing helps identify the underlying cause.\n- **To evaluate kidney function**: Chronic kidney disease can affect the production of erythropoietin, leading to anemia.\n- **To monitor bone marrow function**: In cases where bone marrow issues are suspected, such as in bone marrow diseases or cancers.\n- **To assess the effects of chemotherapy**: EPO levels may be tested in patients undergoing cancer treatment to check how chemotherapy affects red blood cell production.\n- **To investigate unexplained fatigue or weakness**: If other symptoms point to issues with oxygen delivery in the body, EPO testing can provide insights.\n\n## How Is Erythropoietin Testing Conducted?\n\nErythropoietin levels are measured through a [blood test](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview). A sample of venous blood is collected, typically from a vein in the arm, and then analyzed in a laboratory using specialized techniques. The most common method used to measure EPO levels is the immunochemiluminescence assay.\n\nThis test is often ordered alongside other blood tests, such as:\n\n- [**Complete Blood Count (CBC)**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/cbc-blood-test): To assess the overall number of red blood cells and other components of the blood.\n- **Reticulocyte Count**: To measure immature red blood cells and evaluate bone marrow activity.\n- **Kidney Function Tests**: To check for any underlying kidney issues that might be affecting EPO production.\n\nSpecial preparations before the test include:\n\n- **Fasting for at least 8 hours**: This helps ensure accurate test results.\n- **Stopping certain medications**: After consulting with a doctor, you may need to stop taking specific medications 24 hours prior to the test.\n\n## What Are the Normal Erythropoietin Levels?\n\nFor adults, normal erythropoietin levels typically range between **2.6 and 18.5 mlU/mL**.\n\n**Note:** _The units of measurement and the normal ranges can differ depending on the laboratory and the specific methods used._\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## What Do Abnormal Erythropoietin Levels Mean?\n\n### Erythropoietin High Levels\n\nHigh EPO levels can indicate the body is overproducing red blood cells or compensating for low oxygen levels. Below are common causes of elevated EPO levels:\n\n- **Kidney cysts or adenocarcinoma**: Tumors in the kidneys can lead to increased production of erythropoietin.\n- **Cerebellar tumors**: Certain brain tumors may also stimulate excess EPO production.\n- **Polycystic kidney disease**: A genetic condition that leads to cyst formation in the kidneys, which may trigger increased EPO.\n- [**Iron deficiency anemia**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/iron): The body produces more EPO to compensate for the lack of oxygen transport caused by insufficient iron.\n- **Hemolytic anemia**: This type of anemia occurs when red blood cells are destroyed faster than the body can produce them, leading to elevated EPO.\n- [**Pregnancy**](https://docus.ai/tags/pregnancy): During pregnancy, the demand for oxygen increases, which can cause higher EPO levels.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\nTo help manage high erythropoietin levels, consider the following tips:\n\n- **Consult with your doctor**: If a tumor or kidney condition is suspected, seek appropriate medical treatment.\n- **Monitor iron intake**: Ensure you’re getting the right amount of iron, as iron deficiency can contribute to high EPO levels.\n- **Stay hydrated**: Proper kidney function is essential in regulating EPO, so drink enough water to support your kidneys.\n- **Follow up on medical tests**: Regularly check your red blood cell count and kidney function.\n\n### Erythropoietin Low Levels\n\nLow EPO levels often point to issues with red blood cell production, leading to insufficient oxygen supply to the body. Here are some of the common causes:\n\n- **Chronic kidney disease**: Damaged kidneys may not produce enough erythropoietin, leading to anemia.\n- **Primary polycythemia**: A rare condition in which the bone marrow produces too many red blood cells, often suppressing EPO production.\n- **Rheumatoid arthritis**: This autoimmune disorder can lead to chronic inflammation, which suppresses EPO production.\n- **Multiple myeloma**: A type of [cancer](https://docus.ai/tags/cancer) that affects plasma cells in the bone marrow, leading to reduced EPO levels.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\nIf you have low erythropoietin levels, consider the following management strategies:\n\n- **Treat underlying kidney conditions**: Work with a healthcare provider to address any kidney issues, as healthy kidneys are crucial for normal EPO production.\n- **Consume iron-rich foods**: Increasing your intake of iron-rich foods, such as leafy greens and lean meats, may help improve anemia.\n- **Stay physically active**: Regular exercise can improve overall circulation and oxygen levels in your body.\n- **Follow doctor’s advice for further testing**: If an autoimmune disorder or bone marrow issue is suspected, additional testing and treatments may be needed.\n\n### Which Specialist Should You Consult?\n\nDepending on the cause of your abnormal erythropoietin levels, you may need to consult with different medical specialists:\n\n- **Physician**: For general management and further testing.\n- **Hematologist**: If blood disorders like anemia or polycythemia are suspected.\n- **Nephrologist**: If kidney disease or dysfunction is contributing to abnormal EPO levels.\n- **Oncologist**: In cases where a tumor or cancer is affecting erythropoietin production.\n\nRegular check-ups and following the advice of your healthcare team are essential for managing any condition that affects erythropoietin levels.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Can lifestyle changes naturally boost erythropoietin levels?\n\nWhile there are no direct lifestyle changes to increase erythropoietin production, staying active, maintaining good kidney health, and eating iron-rich foods can support red blood cell production and improve overall oxygen levels in your body.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Can low erythropoietin levels affect my energy and daily performance?\n\nAbsolutely. Low EPO levels can lead to anemia, which results in reduced oxygen supply to tissues, making you feel fatigued, weak, and less energetic in your daily activities.\n\nHave more questions?
