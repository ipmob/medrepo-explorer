This makes this biomarker a vital tool for diagnosing and treating gut-related conditions.\n\nMonitoring its levels is essential for effective treatment.\n\nContents\n\n- [What Is Calprotectin?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/calprotectin#what-is-calprotectin)\n- [When Is Calprotectin Testing Recommended?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/calprotectin#when-is-calprotectin-testing-recommended)\n- [How Is Calprotectin Testing Conducted?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/calprotectin#how-is-calprotectin-testing-conducted)\n- [What Are the Normal Calprotectin Levels?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/calprotectin#what-are-the-normal-calprotectin-levels)\n- [What Do High Calprotectin Levels Mean?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/calprotectin#what-do-high-calprotectin-levels-mean)\n\n## What Is Calprotectin?\n\nCalprotectin is a protein released by certain [white blood cells](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/white-blood-cell) during inflammation. It helps the immune system fight infections and repair tissue damage.\n\nMeasuring calprotectin levels in the gastrointestinal tract provides valuable information about digestive health.\n\nThis test differentiates between functional bowel disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and diseases that cause physical damage to the intestinal lining.\n\nIn some cases, monitoring fecal calprotectin levels helps detect intestinal cancer or polyps.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Your Personal AI Doctor\n\nCustomize your AI Doctor to ask any health-related questions. Get instant answers and tailored health insights.\n\n[Get Started](https://docus.ai/ai-doctor)\n\n## When Is Calprotectin Testing Recommended?\n\nTesting for stool calprotectin is commonly recommended in the following scenarios::\n\n- Differentiate between **functional bowel disorders** (like IBS) and **organic diseases** (like IBD).\n- Monitor inflammation in conditions like **Crohn's disease** or **ulcerative colitis**.\n- Check for early recurrence of **chronic inflammatory bowel disease**.\n- Detect intestinal **neoplasms** or **tumors**.\n- Diagnose necrotizing **enterocolitis** in newborns.\n- Assess **drug effects** that may harm the intestinal lining.\n- Investigate **persistent diarrhea** or **acute diarrheal syndromes**.\n- Evaluate **recovery of the intestinal mucosa** after infections.\n\n## How Is Calprotectin Testing Conducted?\n\nThe fecal calprotectin test involves **analyzing a stool sample** to measure the protein’s concentration. The process includes these steps:\n\n- **Sample Collection**: The patient collects a small amount of stool in a sterile container.\n- **Laboratory Analysis**: The sample is processed to determine calprotectin levels using specialized testing equipment.\n\nTests like comprehensive [stool analyses](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/stool-test) include calprotectin as part of a broader assessment.\n\nFor the most accurate results, patients should follow these preparation guidelines:\n\n- Maintain a normal diet for three days before testing.\n- Avoid collecting stool samples within five days of:\n  - Using enemas.\n  - Undergoing X-rays or colonoscopy.\n  - Taking medications that affect intestinal motility.\n\n## What Are the Normal Calprotectin Levels?\n\nIn adults, calprotectin levels typically range between **0-50 mcg/g**.\n\nLevels within this range suggest no significant inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n**Note**: _The units of measurement and normal ranges may vary depending on the laboratory and specific testing methods used._\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## What Do High Calprotectin Levels Mean?\n\nElevated calprotectin levels suggest significant inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. Common causes include:\n\n- **Viral or Bacterial Infections**: Pathogens trigger inflammation to fight off the infection.\n- **Food Allergies**: Allergic reactions can inflame the intestinal lining.\n- **Cystic Fibrosis**: This condition can affect digestion and cause inflammation.\n- **Obesity**: Chronic inflammation is common in individuals with obesity.\n- **Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)**: Includes conditions like Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.\n- **Intestinal Damage from Medications**: Certain drugs harm the gut lining, leading to inflammation.\n- **Antibiotic-Associated Diarrhea**: Overuse of antibiotics disrupts gut health and increases inflammation.\n- **Malignant Intestinal Tumors**: Cancer in the gastrointestinal tract can elevate calprotectin levels.\n\n### Recommendations\n\nTo manage high calprotectin levels:\n\n- Follow a balanced, anti-inflammatory diet.\n- Consult a doctor for proper treatment of underlying conditions.\n- Avoid overusing medications that harm the intestinal lining.\n- Manage stress, as it can worsen gut inflammation.\n- Stay hydrated to support overall digestive health.\n\n### Which Specialist Should You Consult?\n\nIf your calprotectin levels are abnormal, the following specialists can provide guidance:\n\n- **Family Doctor or General Practitioner**: For initial evaluation and referral.\n- **Pediatrician**: For children showing symptoms of gut inflammation.\n- **Gastroenterologist**: To diagnose and treat digestive conditions.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What level of calprotectin indicates cancer?\n\nHigh levels, often significantly **above 200 mcg/g**, may indicate cancer, but further testing is required for confirmation.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What is a dangerous calprotectin level?\n\nCalprotectin levels **above 250 mcg/g** are typically considered concerning and may indicate severe inflammation or serious conditions.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What level of calprotectin indicates IBS?\n\nIBS is usually associated with calprotectin levels within the normal range (0-50 mcg/g) since it doesn’t involve significant inflammation.\n\nHave more questions?
