It helps diagnose and monitor muscle health, so understanding its levels is important for detecting muscle damage or disorders.\n\nContents\n\n- [What Is Myoglobin?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/myoglobin#what-is-myoglobin)\n- [When Is Myoglobin Testing Recommended?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/myoglobin#when-is-myoglobin-testing-recommended)\n- [How Is Myoglobin Testing Conducted?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/myoglobin#how-is-myoglobin-testing-conducted)\n- [What Are the Normal Myoglobin Levels?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/myoglobin#what-are-the-normal-myoglobin-levels)\n- [What Do High Levels Mean?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/myoglobin#what-do-high-levels-mean)\n\n## What Is Myoglobin?\n\nMyoglobin is a protein found in your **muscles**, especially in the heart and skeletal muscles. Its main job is to store and carry oxygen to muscle cells, which helps muscles work properly, especially during physical activity.\n\nWhen muscles are damaged, myoglobin can enter the bloodstream in larger amounts. Because of this, doctors use myoglobin as a marker to check for muscle damage or injury.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Your Personal AI Doctor\n\nCustomize your AI Doctor to ask any health-related questions.

This test can be prescribed when:\n\n- A person has experienced **trauma** or **injury** affecting muscle tissue.\n- Symptoms of muscle-related conditions are present, such as **muscle pain**, **weakness**, or **cramping**.\n- An athlete experiences unexplained **muscle fatigue** or **prolonged soreness**.\n- A doctor suspects **rhabdomyolysis**(a severe breakdown of muscle tissue).\n- The patient reports symptoms such as **persistent tingling**, **spasms**, or **muscle convulsions**.\n\n## How Is Myoglobin Testing Conducted?\n\nMyoglobin levels can be measured using blood or urine samples. The most common method used in laboratories is the **radioimmunoassay** (RIA), which is effective in detecting even low levels of the protein.\n\nHere's how the testing process works:\n\n- [**Blood Test**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview): A venous blood sample is drawn from the arm.\n- [**Urine Test**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/urinalysis-test): A sample of urine is collected to assess myoglobin content, often used when kidney function is a concern due to muscle damage.\n\nGenerally, **no special preparation is needed** before taking a myoglobin test. However, patients should follow any instructions provided by their doctor or testing center.\n\n## What Are the Normal Myoglobin Levels?\n\nIn blood tests, normal myoglobin levels can vary depending on gender:\n\n- **For men**: Levels should be less than 91 ng/mL (nanograms per milliliter).\n- **For women**: Levels should be less than 63 ng/mL.\n\nIn urine tests, myoglobin is usually present in very low amounts or not at all. A normal urine myoglobin test result is often reported as \"negative,\" indicating no detectable levels.\n\n**Note**: _The units of measurement and the normal ranges can differ depending on the laboratory and the specific methods used for analysis_\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## What Do High Levels Mean?\n\nHigh levels of myoglobin in the blood can be concerning as they suggest muscle damage. Elevated myoglobin can also be detected in urine, which may indicate severe muscle damage impacting kidney function.\n\nSome common causes of high myoglobin levels include:\n\n- **Muscle Injuries**: Trauma, accidents, or physical exertion can cause myoglobin to leak into the bloodstream and urine.\n- **Myositis**: Inflammation of the muscles leads to elevated levels in both blood and urine.\n- **Rhabdomyolysis**: A severe condition where muscle fibers break down rapidly, releasing large amounts of myoglobin that can show up in the blood and urine.\n- **Muscle Dystrophy**: Progressive muscle weakening can cause increased myoglobin levels in both blood and urine.\n- **Overuse of Certain Substances**: Using substances that put excessive strain on muscles can result in higher myoglobin levels in the blood and urine.\n\nIn cases of very high myoglobin levels in urine, there is a risk of kidney damage as the kidneys work to filter out the excess protein.\n\n### Recommendations\n\nTo manage high myoglobin levels, consider the following:\n\n- Reduce or modify physical activities to allow muscle recovery.\n- Stay hydrated to help flush excess myoglobin through the kidneys.\n- Consult a healthcare provider for a tailored plan.\n- Follow a balanced diet that supports muscle repair, including adequate protein intake.\n\n### Which Specialist Should You Consult?\n\nIf your test results show abnormal myoglobin levels, it is essential to seek advice from a specialist. The type of specialist may vary based on your symptoms and test outcomes:\n\n- **General Practitioner (GP)**: A GP can provide initial assessments and determine if further investigation is needed.\n- **Neurologist**: For muscle-related issues accompanied by neurological symptoms, a neurologist is an appropriate choice.\n- **Rehabilitologist**: If your condition involves muscle injury or recovery from physical trauma, a rehabilitologist can help with treatment plans.\n\nBy consulting with the right healthcare professional, you can ensure that any underlying issues related to myoglobin levels are identified and managed effectively.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Is myoglobin a type of blood?\n\nNo, myoglobin is not a type of blood. It is a protein found in muscle tissues that stores and carries oxygen.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What is the difference between myoglobin and hemoglobin?\n\nMyoglobin is found in muscles and stores oxygen for muscle use, while hemoglobin is found in red blood cells and transports oxygen throughout the body.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What happens if myoglobin is high?\n\nIf myoglobin levels are excessively high, it can lead to kidney damage as the kidneys filter out the excess protein, potentially causing a condition called acute kidney injury if not treated promptly.\n\nHave more questions?
