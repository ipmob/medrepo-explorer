It controls many important functions, especially in the reproductive system.\n\n**In women**, it prepares the uterus for [pregnancy](https://docus.ai/tags/pregnancy), supports early pregnancy, and controls the menstrual cycle. **In men**, it helps with sperm production.\n\nProgesterone also affects mood, sleep, and other body functions, making it vital for overall health.\n\nProgesterone testing can be useful in diagnosing conditions related to reproductive health. It can also be used to detect certain hormonal imbalances or underlying conditions that affect the adrenal glands or ovaries.\n\n## When Is Progesterone Testing Recommended?\n\nProgesterone testing is recommended in a variety of situations where hormonal balance or reproductive health may be a concern. Below are some common instances when this test may be prescribed:\n\n- **Infertility**: To determine if ovulation is occurring and assess progesterone levels during the luteal phase.\n- [**Menstrual irregularities**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/8-types-of-abnormal-menstruation): In cases of irregular, heavy, or absent periods.\n- **Pregnancy monitoring**: To assess the health of the placenta and fetus.\n- **Suspected miscarriage or pregnancy complications**: Low progesterone levels may indicate a risk of miscarriage.\n- **Menstrual symptoms**: If you experience severe PMS or cramps.\n- **Adrenal or ovarian disorders**: To rule out or confirm conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or adrenal gland disorders.\n\n## How Is Progesterone Testing Conducted?\n\nProgesterone levels can be measured through several different types of tests, depending on the specific circumstances and the healthcare provider’s recommendations. The most common methods include:\n\n- [**Blood test**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview): A small sample of blood is taken from a vein, usually from the arm. This is the most common and reliable way to measure progesterone.\n- **Saliva test**: Saliva samples are used to measure progesterone levels. This method is less invasive but may be used in specific situations.\n- [**Urine test**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/urinalysis-test): A less common approach, urine testing can sometimes be used to measure metabolites of progesterone.\n\nIf you are scheduled for a progesterone test, there may be some special preparations:\n\n- **For a blood test**: No specific preparations are generally required, but it’s important to follow your healthcare provider’s instructions about the timing of the test, as progesterone levels fluctuate throughout the menstrual cycle.\n- **For a saliva test**: Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and smoking for at least 24 hours before the test.\n\n## What Are the Normal Progesterone Levels?\n\nThe normal progesterone levels can vary depending on gender, age, and reproductive status. Below are the general ranges:\n\n- **Males**: 0-0.47 nmol/L\n- **Females (up to 45 years old)**: 0.181-75.9 nmol/L, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle\n- **Females (over 45 years old)**: 0-0.4 nmol/L\n\n**Note:** _The units of measurement and the normal ranges can differ depending on the laboratory and the specific methods used._\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## What Do Abnormal Progesterone Levels Mean?\n\nProgesterone levels outside the normal range can indicate different health conditions, depending on whether they are too high or too low.\n\n### High Levels\n\nHigh levels of progesterone may suggest certain health conditions or stages of reproductive life. These causes include:\n\n- **Pregnancy**: A natural increase in progesterone is essential for maintaining pregnancy.\n- [**Ovarian cysts**](https://docus.ai/tags/ovarian-cysts): Progesterone levels may rise due to cysts in the ovaries.\n- **Adrenal gland cancer**: Malignant tumors in the adrenal glands can cause an overproduction of progesterone.\n- **Ovarian cancer**: Some forms of ovarian cancer can lead to elevated progesterone levels.\n- **Congenital adrenal hyperplasia**: A genetic condition affecting adrenal gland function, leading to hormonal imbalances, including high progesterone.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\nIf your progesterone levels are high, consider the following steps to help manage the condition, with guidance from your healthcare provider:\n\n- Work with your doctor to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.\n- Monitor your hormone levels regularly if you have ongoing issues.\n- Manage any underlying conditions like ovarian cysts or adrenal gland disorders through medication or surgical interventions if recommended.\n\n### Low Levels\n\nLow progesterone levels can cause symptoms related to hormonal imbalance or reproductive difficulties. Common causes include:\n\n- **Severe stress**: Chronic stress can interfere with hormone production, leading to low progesterone levels.\n- **Poor diet**: A diet lacking in essential nutrients can impair hormone production.\n- **Obesity**: Excess body fat can lead to imbalanced hormone levels, including lower progesterone.\n- **Threat of miscarriage**: Low progesterone in pregnancy may signal a higher risk of miscarriage.\n- **Amenorrhea**: The absence of menstruation may indicate low progesterone levels.\n- **Insulin resistance**: This condition can disrupt hormone production and balance, including progesterone.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\nTo manage low progesterone levels, consider these strategies:\n\n- **Stress management**: Practice relaxation techniques like yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises.\n- **Dietary changes**: Focus on a balanced diet rich in healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals that support hormone production.\n- **Exercise**: Regular, moderate exercise can help regulate hormone levels and improve overall health.\n- **Weight management**: If necessary, work towards a healthy weight to support balanced hormones.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Your Personal AI Doctor\n\nCustomize your AI Doctor to ask any health-related questions.

However, this effect varies and is usually short-term.\n\nHave more questions?
