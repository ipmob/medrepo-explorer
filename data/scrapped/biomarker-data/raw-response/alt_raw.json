Elevated ALT levels in the bloodstream can be a sign of liver damage or other health issues, making it essential to understand what your ALT levels mean and when to get tested.\n\nContents\n\n- [What Is ALT?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/alt#what-is-alt)\n- [When Is ALT Testing Recommended?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/alt#when-is-alt-testing-recommended)\n- [How Is ALT Testing Conducted?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/alt#how-is-alt-testing-conducted)\n- [What Are the Normal ALT Levels?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/alt#what-are-the-normal-alt-levels)\n- [What Do Abnormal Levels Mean?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/alt#what-do-abnormal-levels-mean)\n\n## What Is ALT?\n\nALT is an **enzyme** that helps convert proteins into energy. While its major activity occurs in the liver, smaller amounts are found in the kidneys, heart, muscles, and pancreas. Typically, ALT levels in the blood are low. However, when liver cells are damaged, they release ALT into the bloodstream, leading to elevated levels.\n\nMonitoring ALT levels is crucial because it provides insight into liver health. Abnormally high or low ALT levels can indicate a range of health issues, from minor liver irritations to severe diseases like liver cancer.\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## When Is ALT Testing Recommended?\n\nALT testing is commonly prescribed when symptoms of liver disease appear. Some key indicators include:\n\n- Weakness and fatigue\n- Itchy skin\n- Loss of appetite\n- Dark-colored urine\n- Light-colored stool\n- [Stomach pain](https://docus.ai/tags/stomach-pain), [nausea](https://docus.ai/tags/nausea), [vomiting](https://docus.ai/tags/vomiting)\n- Jaundice (yellow skin or eyes)\n- Family history of liver disease\n- Excessive alcohol consumption\n- Drug use that can affect the liver\n- Obesity, [diabetes](https://docus.ai/tags/diabetes), or metabolic syndrome\n\n## How Is ALT Testing Conducted?\n\nALT levels are typically measured using a blood test, often as part of a Comprehensive [Metabolic Panel](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/metabolic-panel) (CMP).\n\nTo ensure accurate results, follow these preparation steps:\n\n- **Fasting:** Do not eat 8 hours before the test; you can drink water.\n- **Avoid Alcohol:** Refrain from alcohol 24 hours before testing.\n- **Stress Management:** Avoid physical or emotional stress 30 minutes before the test.\n- **No Smoking:** Do not smoke 30 minutes before the test.\n\n## What Are the Normal ALT Levels?\n\nALT levels can vary based on age, gender, and overall health. Here are the standard and optimal ranges:\n\n**Children:**\n\n- **Males (Over 1 year old):** 7–55 IU/L\n- **Females (Over 1 year old):** 7–45 IU/L\n\n**Pregnant Women:**\n\n- **First Trimester:** 3–30 IU/L\n- **Second Trimester:** 2–33 IU/L\n- **Third Trimester:** 2–25 IU/L\n\n**Adults:**\n\n- **General Range:** 10–30 IU/L\n\n**Note** _: The units of measurement and the normal ranges can differ depending on the laboratory and the specific methods used._\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## What Do Abnormal Levels Mean?\n\n### ALT High Levels\n\nHigh ALT levels are often associated with liver conditions but can also indicate other health problems. Here are some conditions linked to elevated ALT:\n\n- **Heatstroke:** High temperatures can cause liver damage, leading to increased ALT.\n- **Red Blood Cell Damage:** Conditions like hemolysis can release ALT into the blood.\n- **Muscle Injury:** Damage to muscles, especially in severe cases like rhabdomyolysis, can raise ALT levels.\n- **Drug Overdose (e.g., Paracetamol):** Overdosing on certain medications can cause liver toxicity, reflected by high ALT.\n- **Excessive Vitamin A:** Overconsumption of [vitamin A](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/vitamin-a) can be toxic to the liver.\n- **Acute Viral Hepatitis:** Infections like hepatitis A, B, or C can cause liver inflammation and elevate ALT.\n- **Kidney Damage:** Although less common, kidney damage can also raise ALT levels.\n- **Chronic Liver Disease:** Conditions like hepatitis and fatty liver disease often result in high ALT.\n- **Bile Ducts Blockage:** Obstructions in the bile ducts can cause liver cells to leak ALT into the bloodstream.\n- **Heart Attack or Heart Failure:** Heart-related conditions can impact liver function, raising ALT.\n- **Cirrhosis:** This advanced liver disease often shows high ALT as the liver becomes increasingly damaged.\n- **Liver Cancer:** ALT can be significantly elevated in liver cancer.\n- **Alcohol Abuse:** Chronic alcohol consumption can severely damage the liver, resulting in high ALT.\n- **Epstein-Barr Virus Infection:** This virus, responsible for mononucleosis, can also affect liver function.\n- **Drug Use (e.g., Statins, Aspirin):** Some medications can cause liver stress, reflected by high ALT.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\nTo manage high ALT levels, consider the following recommendations:\n\n- **Consult a Healthcare Provider:** Seek medical advice to identify and treat underlying causes of elevated ALT.\n- **Limit Alcohol Consumption:** Reducing or eliminating alcohol can help prevent further liver damage.\n- **Monitor Medication Use:** Be cautious with medications known to affect the liver, and consult your doctor for alternatives if necessary.\n- **Maintain a Healthy Diet:** Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains to support liver health.\n- **Stay Hydrated:** Drinking plenty of water can help flush toxins from your body.\n- **Exercise Regularly:** Regular physical activity can improve liver function and reduce ALT levels.\n- **Avoid Excessive Vitamin A:** Ensure you are not consuming more than the recommended daily amount of vitamin A.\n- **Manage Stress:** Practice stress-reducing techniques like meditation or deep breathing to support overall health.\n\n### ALT Low Levels\n\nWhile less common, low ALT levels can also signal health issues or lifestyle factors:\n\n- **Vitamin B6 Deficiency:** B6 is essential for ALT production, so a deficiency can lead to low levels.\n- **Smoking:** Tobacco use has been linked to lower ALT levels.\n- **Chronic Kidney Disease:** Some kidney conditions can result in decreased ALT.\n- **Heart Disease:** Certain heart conditions may correlate with low ALT levels.\n- **Aging:** Natural aging can reduce ALT production.\n- **Regular Exercise:** Consistent physical activity can lower ALT levels as it improves overall liver health.\n- **Hormone Therapy:** [Birth control](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/birth-control-options) pills or hormone replacement therapy may reduce ALT.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\nTo manage low ALT levels, consider the following recommendations:\n\n- **Increase Vitamin B6 Intake:** Incorporate foods rich in vitamin B6, such as poultry, fish, potatoes, and non-citrus fruits.\n- **Quit Smoking:** Reducing or quitting smoking can help improve overall liver function and ALT levels.\n- **Monitor Kidney Health:** Regular check-ups with your healthcare provider can help manage and treat any underlying kidney conditions.\n- **Cardiovascular Care:** Maintain a heart-healthy lifestyle through a balanced diet, regular exercise, and stress management.\n- **Healthy Aging:** Engage in activities that promote liver health, such as a balanced diet and regular exercise, as you age.\n- **Review Hormone Therapy:** Consult your doctor to discuss any potential effects of hormone therapy on your liver and consider alternative options if necessary.\n\n### Which Specialist Should You Consult?\n\nIf your ALT levels are abnormal, it's important to consult the appropriate specialist. A **hepatologist**, who specializes in liver conditions, or a **cardiologist**, if heart-related issues are suspected, can provide further diagnosis and treatment.\n\n#### Sources\n\nThis article was written by doctors from the Docus Medical Research team and leading experts in cardiology.
