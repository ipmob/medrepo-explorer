Proteins are essential for many functions in the body, such as building tissues, transporting substances, and fighting infections. The two main types of protein measured are [**albumin**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/albumin) and [**globulin**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/globulin).\n\n**Albumin** helps transport hormones and nutrients, while **globulin** plays a key role in the immune system. Checking total protein levels is often used to help diagnose various diseases or conditions, particularly those related to the [liver](https://docus.ai/tags/liver), kidneys, or immune system.\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## When Is Total Protein Testing Recommended?\n\nTotal protein testing is commonly used to monitor general health and detect certain conditions. It may be recommended in the following cases:\n\n- To check liver or kidney function\n- When there is difficulty urinating or unexplained swelling in the body\n- To identify the cause of fluid buildup in the lungs, which may cause shortness of breath\n- When an infection or chronic inflammation is suspected\n- To investigate blood disorders, such as certain types of [cancer](https://docus.ai/tags/cancer) affecting the blood\n\n## How Is Total Protein Testing Conducted?\n\nTotal protein is measured through a [**blood test**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview), which is part of several broader tests, such as a [**comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/metabolic-panel#types-of-metabolic-panels-bmp-and-cmp) or a **basic metabolic panel (BMP)**. During the test, a small blood sample is taken from a vein in your arm and sent to a laboratory for analysis.\n\n**Preparation for the Test**\n\n- **Fasting**: You should not eat for at least 8 hours before the test. Drinking water is allowed.\n- **Avoid alcohol**: Refrain from drinking alcohol for 24 hours before the test.\n- **Minimize stress**: Stay calm and avoid any physical or emotional stress 30 minutes before the test.\n- **No smoking**: Avoid smoking 30 minutes before the test.\n\n## What Are the Normal Total Protein Levels?\n\nNormal total protein levels can vary slightly based on age and health condition. The general normal ranges are:\n\n- **Adults**: 60–83 g/L\n- **Children**:\n\n  - 1 year old: 51–73 g/L\n  - 3 years old: 56–75 g/L\n  - 17 years old: 60–80 g/L\n\n**Note** _: The units of measurement and the normal ranges can differ depending on the laboratory and the specific methods used_\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## What Do Abnormal Total Protein Levels Mean?\n\n### Total Protein High Levels\n\nHigh total protein levels can indicate several underlying conditions. Elevated protein levels may suggest:\n\n- **Dehydration**: A lack of sufficient water in the body can cause higher protein concentrations in the blood.\n- **Chronic infections**: Conditions such as hepatitis or tuberculosis can lead to an increase in protein levels.\n- **Blood disorders**: Diseases like multiple myeloma or other cancers affecting the blood can result in elevated total protein.\n- [**Autoimmune diseases**](https://docus.ai/tags/autoimmune-diseases): Certain immune system disorders can cause higher protein levels due to increased immune activity.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\n- **Increase** [**hydration**](https://docus.ai/tags/hydration): Drink more water to prevent dehydration.\n- **Consult a healthcare provider**: To investigate any underlying infections or diseases.\n- **Follow medical advice**: For managing chronic conditions, blood disorders, or autoimmune diseases.\n\n### Total Protein Low Levels\n\nLow total protein levels can indicate that the body is not getting enough protein or that there are problems with protein absorption or loss. Possible causes include:\n\n- **Malnutrition**: A diet lacking in sufficient protein can result in low total protein levels.\n- **Liver or** [**kidney diseases**](https://docus.ai/tags/kidney-diseases): These organs are responsible for producing and filtering proteins. Damage or disease can lead to lower protein levels.\n- **Chronic illnesses**: Conditions like Crohn’s disease or celiac disease can interfere with protein absorption.\n- **Post-surgical recovery**: After surgery, the body may need time to restore normal protein levels.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\n- **Improve diet**: Eat more protein-rich foods such as lean meats, beans, and dairy products.\n- **Manage chronic diseases**: Work with your healthcare provider to treat conditions affecting protein absorption.\n- **Monitor liver and kidney health**: Follow up with regular check-ups to ensure these organs are functioning properly.\n\n### Which Specialist Should You Consult?\n\nIf your total protein levels are abnormal, you may need to consult different specialists depending on the underlying cause. Consider seeing:\n\n- A **hepatologist** for liver-related issues\n- A **nephrologist** for kidney concerns\n- A **gastroenterologist** for digestion and absorption problems\n- An **immunologist** if autoimmune diseases are suspected\n\n#### Sources\n\nThis article was written by doctors from the Docus Medical Research team and reviewed by leading nephrology, gastroenterology, and immunology experts.
