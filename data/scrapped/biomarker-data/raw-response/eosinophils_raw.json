They are part of the body's defense against parasites and infections, particularly in the respiratory system.\n\nEosinophils are also involved in allergic reactions and inflammatory processes, contributing to conditions like [asthma](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/asthma), hay fever, and atopic dermatitis.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Your Personal AI Doctor\n\nCustomize your AI Doctor to ask any health-related questions. Get instant answers and tailored health insights.\n\n[Get Started](https://docus.ai/ai-doctor)\n\n## When Is Eosinophil Testing Recommended?\n\nEosinophil testing is often ordered when symptoms of conditions influenced by eosinophils are present. The test may be prescribed in the following situations:\n\n- **Allergic reactions**: When symptoms of an allergy, such as skin rashes, asthma, or hives, are present.\n- **Suspected parasitic infections**: When a parasitic infection is suspected based on symptoms like gastrointestinal distress or unexplained weight loss.\n- **Chronic respiratory conditions**: If a person has ongoing issues with asthma or allergic rhinitis.\n- **Bone-related issues**: In the case of unexplained fractures or other signs of bone marrow problems.\n- **Fever or inflammation**: When there is unexplained fever or signs of systemic inflammation.\n- **Hematologic concerns**: If abnormalities are found in a complete blood count (CBC).\n\n## How Is Eosinophil Testing Conducted?\n\nEosinophil levels are most commonly measured using a [**blood test**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview), typically as part of a [**Complete Blood Count (CBC)**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/cbc-blood-test). This test evaluates the overall health of an individual and provides a count of different types of blood cells, including eosinophils.\n\nIn some cases, a more detailed analysis may be performed using [**flow cytometry**](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5939936/#:~:text=Flow%20cytometry%20is%20a%20technology,as%20photodiodes%20or%20photomultiplier%20tubes.), which is considered the \"gold standard\" for measuring these cells.\n\n**Special Preparations for the Test:**\n\n- Generally, no special preparation is required before having an eosinophil test.\n- However, if you are undergoing a CBC, it is often recommended to fast for at least 8 hours before the test to ensure the accuracy of the results, though this depends on the specific tests being performed.\n- Inform your doctor about any medications or supplements you are taking, as they might influence the test results.\n\n## What Are the Normal Eosinophil Levels?\n\nEosinophil levels can vary by age and sex, and they are generally measured in terms of **absolute count (cells per liter)** and **percentage of total white blood cells**.\n\n**Standard Values (Absolute Count)**:\n\n- **Children (age-dependent)**:\n\n\n  - Up to 2 years old: 0.02-0.82×10^9/L\n  - Up to 3 years old: 0.03-0.53×10^9/L\n  - Up to 11 years old: 0.00-0.50×10^9/L\n  - Up to 17 years old: 0.10-0.20×10^9/L\n- **Adults**: 0.03-0.48×10^9/L\n\n**Standard Values (Percentage)**:\n\n- **Children**:\n\n\n  - Younger than 1 year: 1-6%\n  - 2 years old: 1-7%\n  - 4 years old: 1-6%\n- **Adults**: 1-4%\n\n**Note**: _The exact values and units may vary depending on the laboratory and testing methods used. Always consult your doctor for interpretation specific to your situation._\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## What Do Abnormal Levels Mean?\n\nAbnormal eosinophil levels can indicate various underlying health issues. High or low eosinophil levels are associated with different conditions and can be a signal that further investigation is necessary.\n\n### Eosinophil High Levels\n\nElevated eosinophil levels, a condition known as **eosinophilia**, can be a response to several factors, including:\n\n- **Allergic reactions**: Allergies trigger the release of eosinophils, especially in conditions like asthma or allergic rhinitis.\n- **Parasitic infections**: Eosinophils are essential in combating parasites, particularly those affecting the gastrointestinal system.\n- [**Autoimmune diseases**](https://docus.ai/tags/autoimmune-diseases): Conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus can lead to increased eosinophil counts due to chronic inflammation.\n- **Hypereosinophilic syndrome**: A rare condition characterized by abnormally high eosinophil counts that can cause damage to organs.\n- **Cancer**: Some cancers, like certain types of leukemia or lymphoma, can cause elevated eosinophil levels.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\n- **Work with your doctor** to determine the underlying cause of high eosinophil levels.\n- **Check for** [**vitamin D**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/vitamin-d) **deficiency**, as it has been linked to various immune system responses, including eosinophil activity.\n- **Avoid cigarette smoke** and other environmental allergens, as these can exacerbate eosinophilic responses.\n\n### Eosinophil Low Levels\n\nA low eosinophil count, known as **eosinopenia**, is less common but can still be an indicator of certain health problems. It may result from:\n\n- **Alcohol intoxication**: High alcohol intake can suppress eosinophil production in the bone marrow.\n- **Cushing’s disease**: This condition, caused by excess cortisol in the body, can lead to a reduction in eosinophil levels.\n- **Use of certain medications**: Steroid medications are known to lower eosinophil counts as they suppress immune responses.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\n- **Monitor and manage alcohol consumption**, as excessive drinking can affect immune system functioning.\n- **Consider your cortisol levels** if you have symptoms of Cushing’s disease, such as unexplained weight gain or high blood pressure.\n- **Review medications** with your healthcare provider, especially if you are taking steroids or other immune-suppressing drugs.\n\n### Which Specialist Should You Consult?\n\nIf your eosinophil levels are abnormal, consult the right specialist based on the cause:\n\n- **Hematologist**: For conditions related to blood and bone marrow, such as leukemia or hypereosinophilic syndrome.\n- **Parasitologist**: If parasitic infections are suspected as the cause of elevated eosinophil levels.\n- **Allergist or immunologist**: For allergic conditions like asthma, rhinitis, or eczema.\n- **Infectious disease specialist**: For infections that may lead to abnormal eosinophil counts.\n- **Endocrinologist**: If eosinophil changes are linked to conditions like Cushing’s disease.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What level of eosinophils indicates cancer?\n\nThere is no specific eosinophil count that directly indicates cancer. However, significantly elevated eosinophil levels, especially in cases of lymphoma or leukemia, may suggest the need for further investigation. A doctor will consider other symptoms and diagnostic tests to determine if cancer is present.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Can eosinophil levels fluctuate during the year?\n\nYes, eosinophil levels can fluctuate depending on seasonal allergies or changes in environmental exposure. Individuals with allergic conditions may notice higher levels during allergy seasons due to increased immune system activity.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# How can I lower my eosinophil levels naturally?\n\nTo help manage high eosinophil levels, focus on controlling allergens that trigger immune responses, such as avoiding pollen, pet dander, or certain foods. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, managing stress, and following medical advice are also important for immune health.\n\nHave more questions?
