It shows how efficiently the kidneys balance water, salts, and waste.\n\nThis biomarker helps diagnose health conditions, particularly those involving **kidney function**, **hydration levels**, and certain **hormonal disorders**.\n\nThe kidneys work constantly to filter blood. They reabsorb water and nutrients while removing waste through urine. Specific gravity reveals the density of urine compared to water, indicating if the kidneys retain or release too much fluid.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Your Personal AI Doctor\n\nCustomize your AI Doctor to ask any health-related questions.

There are two common methods used for measuring urine specific gravity:\n\n1. **Dipstick Test**: A chemical strip that reacts with the urine sample to show an approximate specific gravity value.\n2. **Refractometry**: A laboratory technique that uses light refraction to measure the concentration of substances in the urine. This method provides more precise measurements.\n\n**Special Preparations for the Test**\n\n- **Hydration**: Avoid excessive water intake before the test, as it can dilute urine and affect results.\n- **Medication Disclosure**: Inform your doctor of any medications, as some can alter urine concentration.\n- **Follow Instructions for 24-Hour Collection**: In cases of a 24-hour urine collection, ensure all urine is collected as instructed to get an accurate reading.\n\n## What Are the Normal Urine Specific Gravity Levels?\n\nFor adults, normal specific gravity levels generally range from **1.002 to 1.030**. This range indicates normal kidney function and a proper balance between fluid intake and waste excretion.\n\n**Note**: _The units of measurement and normal ranges can differ depending on the laboratory and the specific methods used._\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## What Do Abnormal Urine Specific Gravity Levels Mean?\n\nDeviations from the normal specific gravity range can signal various health issues. These are generally categorized as either high or low specific gravity, each with specific underlying causes\n\n### Specific Gravity of Urine High Levels\n\nHigh specific gravity in urine, also called hyperstenuria, indicates that the urine is more concentrated than usual. This can result from conditions causing dehydration or excess solute concentration in the urine.\n\n- **Dehydration**: Lack of sufficient water in the body leads to more concentrated urine.\n- **Inflammatory Diseases**: Conditions with elevated white or red blood cells in the urine can increase its density.\n- **Acute Glomerulonephritis**: Protein accumulation in the urine due to kidney inflammation can raise specific gravity.\n- **Diabetes Mellitus**: Elevated glucose in the urine increases concentration.\n- **Urolithiasis (Kidney Stones)**: An abundance of salts in the urine contributes to higher specific gravity.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\nTo help manage high specific gravity levels:\n\n- **Increase Hydration**: Drink water consistently throughout the day.\n- **Consult Your Doctor**: Work with a healthcare provider to identify and address underlying causes.\n- **Monitor Diet**: Avoid excessive salt and sugar intake, which can contribute to kidney stress.\n- **Track Symptoms**: Keep an eye on symptoms like fatigue, dry mouth, and changes in urine color, reporting them to your healthcare provider.\n\n### Specific Gravity of Urine Low Levels\n\nLow specific gravity, also known as hyposthenuria, shows that the urine is less concentrated than usual. It often points to conditions that affect the kidneys’ ability to retain fluid or dilute urine properly.\n\n- **Diabetes Insipidus**: A hormonal imbalance affecting fluid retention, leading to excessive urine dilution.\n- **Cushing’s Syndrome**: Hormonal changes in this condition can impact kidney function, diluting the urine.\n- **Chronic Pyelonephritis**: Long-term kidney infections may affect urine concentration.\n- **Heart Failure**: Fluid retention in the body can decrease the concentration of urine.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\nTo help manage low specific gravity levels:\n\n- **Moderate Fluid Intake**: Drink enough water to stay hydrated but avoid excessive intake.\n- **Consult Your Doctor**: Seek advice on any underlying health issues contributing to low specific gravity.\n- **Healthy Diet**: Focus on a balanced diet that supports kidney function, including fresh vegetables, fruits, and lean proteins.\n- **Monitor Symptoms**: Watch for signs of fatigue, excessive thirst, or unusually pale urine, and inform your healthcare provider.\n\n### Which Specialist Should You Consult?\n\nIf you receive abnormal specific gravity test results, consider consulting one of the following specialists based on your healthcare provider’s recommendation:\n\n- **General Practitioner (GP)**: For initial diagnosis and routine management.\n- **Urologist**: For kidney and urinary tract-specific issues, including infections and stones.\n- **Nephrologist**: For chronic kidney disease or complex kidney issues requiring specialized care.\n- **Endocrinologist**: When hormonal imbalances like diabetes insipidus or Cushing’s syndrome are suspected.\n\n#### Sources\n\nThis article was written by doctors from the Docus Medical Research team and reviewed by leading nephrology and urology experts.
