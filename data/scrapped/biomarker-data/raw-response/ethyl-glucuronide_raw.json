Measuring EtG levels helps diagnose alcohol use, supporting decisions in treatment plans, especially for liver-related conditions like liver transplant eligibility.\n\nContents\n\n- [What Is Ethyl Glucuronide (EtG)?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/ethyl-glucuronide#what-is-ethyl-glucuronide-etg)\n- [When Is Ethyl Glucuronide (EtG) Testing Recommended?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/ethyl-glucuronide#when-is-ethyl-glucuronide-etg-testing-recommended)\n- [How Is Ethyl Glucuronide (EtG) Testing Conducted?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/ethyl-glucuronide#how-is-ethyl-glucuronide-etg-testing-conducted)\n- [What Are the Normal Ethyl Glucuronide (EtG) Levels?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/ethyl-glucuronide#what-are-the-normal-ethyl-glucuronide-etg-levels)\n- [What Do High EtG Levels Mean?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/ethyl-glucuronide#what-do-high-etg-levels-mean)\n\n## What Is Ethyl Glucuronide (EtG)?\n\nEthyl Glucuronide (EtG) is a biomarker that indicates recent alcohol consumption. Formed when the [liver](https://docus.ai/tags/liver) metabolizes ethanol (alcohol), EtG is a minor metabolite detectable in urine, blood, and hair samples after alcohol intake.\n\nEtG testing is mostly done via a urine sample, often paired with [Ethyl Sulfate (EtS)](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/ets-urine-test) to verify recent alcohol use. Other markers like Phosphatidylethanol (PEth) and Carbohydrate-Deficient Transferrin (CDT) may be added for longer-term intake assessments, especially in liver evaluations.\n\nUnlike ethanol, which the body eliminates in a few hours, EtG can be detected for up to **five days** in the urine, making it a valuable tool for monitoring abstinence and alcohol intake in medical and forensic contexts.\n\nEtG testing is particularly useful in evaluating patients preparing for **liver transplantation**, where confirmed alcohol abstinence is essential.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Your Personal AI Doctor\n\nCustomize your AI Doctor to ask any health-related questions.

Common situations where this test may be prescribed include:\n\n- **Pre-transplant assessment** for patients with alcohol-related liver disease (ArLD) to ensure abstinence.\n- **Post-transplant monitoring** to confirm continued abstinence and promote graft health.\n- **Legal and forensic assessments** in cases where alcohol abstinence is legally required or disputed.\n- **Substance abuse treatment programs** to verify compliance with abstinence-based recovery plans.\n- **Employment screenings** in jobs where alcohol consumption is restricted or prohibited, such as aviation or transportation roles.\n\n## How Is Ethyl Glucuronide (EtG) Testing Conducted?\n\nEtG is typically measured through a **urine test**, which can detect alcohol use within the past five days. Less commonly, blood and hair samples may be used, providing a shorter or longer detection window, respectively.\n\n1. [**Urine Test**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/urinalysis-test): The most common method for EtG testing, requiring a urine sample collection.\n2. [**Blood Test**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview): Less common for EtG but useful for cases where recent consumption within hours needs assessment.\n3. **Hair Test**: Used to detect longer-term alcohol use patterns (weeks to months), although less sensitive for low or single-use events.\n\n### Preparation for the Test\n\nNo special preparation is typically required. However, patients may be advised to avoid products containing alcohol, such as certain mouthwashes or hand sanitizers, as these can potentially cause false positives.\n\n## What Are the Normal Ethyl Glucuronide (EtG) Levels?\n\nIn general, Ethyl Glucuronide (EtG) results are interpreted based on whether the levels indicate recent alcohol consumption. Labs may report EtG levels as a numerical value or use terms like _“positive/negative”_ or _“present/absent,”_ but the interpretation remains the same.\n\nEtG concentrations above **250 ng/mL** in urine generally indicate recent alcohol use.\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## What Do High EtG Levels Mean?\n\nHigh levels of EtG indicate recent alcohol consumption. Elevated EtG can be caused by:\n\n- **Recent Alcohol Use**: Most common reason for high EtG, indicating alcohol intake within the last 3 to 5 days.\n- **Frequent or Heavy Drinking**: Chronic high alcohol use can result in consistently elevated EtG levels in urine.\n- **Inadvertent Exposure**: In rare cases, high EtG levels may result from exposure to alcohol-containing products, like certain medications, hand sanitizers, or hygiene products.\n\n### Recommendations\n\nHigh alcohol intake harms the liver, so reducing or abstaining from alcohol is crucial. Regular monitoring through EtG tests and healthcare guidance supports liver health, especially for transplant candidates or those with liver issues.\n\n### Which Specialist Should You Consult?\n\nFor EtG testing with a focus on liver health, consult a hepatologist, who specializes in liver conditions and can assess the impact of alcohol on liver disease progression.\n\nIf alcohol dependence is a concern, a substance abuse specialist may provide support and treatment options.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# How long can alcohol be detected in urine EtG?\n\nEthyl glucuronide (EtG) can typically be detected in urine for up to 48-72 hours after drinking, though detection time varies based on factors like consumption amount and metabolism.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What is the 80-hour EtG test myth?\n\nThe 80-hour EtG test myth suggests EtG can detect alcohol use for up to 80 hours. While possible in rare cases with heavy alcohol intake, the average detection window for EtG is 48-72 hours.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What are realistic EtG detection times?\n\nRealistic EtG detection times range from 24-72 hours, depending on individual factors and the amount of alcohol consumed.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What is EtG?\n\nEtG, or ethyl glucuronide, is a direct metabolite of ethanol (alcohol) used to detect alcohol consumption in various health and legal settings.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# How long does EtG stay in your urine?\n\nEtG can stay in your urine for 24-72 hours, varying by intake level, personal metabolism, and other health factors.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# How long does alcohol stay in your urine for EtG testing?\n\nFor EtG testing, alcohol can be detected in urine typically for 1-3 days after the last drink, though it may extend up to 4 days in certain cases.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What is Ethyl Glucuronide?\n\nEthyl glucuronide (EtG) is a biomarker of alcohol consumption, commonly measured in urine to monitor alcohol use in medical, legal, and transplant evaluation contexts.\n\nHave more questions?
