It is a key component of [hemoglobin](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/hemoglobin), a protein in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen from the lungs to tissues throughout the body. In addition to oxygen transport, iron is involved in energy production, immune function, and the proper functioning of enzymes in metabolic processes.\n\nIron is stored in the body in two main forms: **transferrin**, which transports iron in the blood, and **ferritin**, which stores iron in tissues. Monitoring iron levels in the body helps diagnose conditions such as [anemia](https://docus.ai/tags/anemia), hemochromatosis (iron overload), and other metabolic disorders.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Your Personal AI Doctor\n\nCustomize your AI Doctor to ask any health-related questions.

This test is not part of a routine annual check-up but is prescribed under certain circumstances. Here are common reasons for recommending iron testing:\n\n- Symptoms of anemia ( [fatigue](https://docus.ai/tags/fatigue), [dizziness](https://docus.ai/tags/dizziness), shortness of breath)\n- Chronic blood loss (such as [heavy menstrual periods](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/8-types-of-abnormal-menstruation#types-of-abnormal-menstruation) or gastrointestinal bleeding)\n- Vegetarian or vegan diet, where iron intake may be lower\n- [Pregnancy](https://docus.ai/tags/pregnancy), when the body needs more iron\n- Chronic diseases such as Crohn's disease or celiac disease\n- Monitoring iron therapy or supplementation\n- After blood transfusions\n- If a doctor suspects iron overload or hemochromatosis\n\n## How Is Iron Testing Conducted?\n\nIron levels are typically measured through a [blood test](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview). The test involves drawing a small sample of blood, usually from a vein in the arm. Several types of blood tests can include iron measurement:\n\n- **Serum Iron Test**: Measures the amount of iron in your blood.\n- **Total Iron-Binding Capacity (TIBC)**: Measures the blood's capacity to bind iron with transferrin.\n- **Ferritin Test**: Measures the amount of stored iron in your body.\n- [**Complete Blood Count (CBC)**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/cbc-blood-test): A broader test that checks hemoglobin levels, which can indicate iron deficiency anemia.\n\n**Special Preparations for Iron Testing**\n\nSome tests may require you to **fast for 8-12 hours before blood is drawn**. Fasting is necessary because food can temporarily increase iron levels in the blood and lead to inaccurate test results. Always follow your healthcare provider’s specific instructions regarding test preparation.\n\n## What Are the Normal Iron Levels?\n\nNormal iron levels can vary based on age, gender, and health conditions, but here are the general ranges for adults:\n\n- **Men**: 50–150 mcg/dL\n- **Women**: 35–145 mcg/dL\n\n**Note:** _The units of measurement and the normal ranges can differ depending on the laboratory and the specific methods used._\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## What Do Abnormal Levels Mean?\n\nIron levels can be higher or lower than normal, which may indicate an underlying health issue. Let's explore what high and low iron levels mean and how they can be managed.\n\n### Iron High Levels\n\nHigh levels of iron in the blood, known as iron overload, can be a sign of various conditions. Some possible causes include:\n\n- **Hemochromatosis**: A genetic condition that causes the body to absorb too much iron from food.\n- **Iron-Rich Diet**: Consuming too many iron-rich foods or fortified products.\n- **Excessive Iron Supplementation**: Overuse of iron supplements without medical supervision.\n- **Multiple Blood Transfusions**: Frequent transfusions can lead to excess iron buildup in the body.\n- **Liver Disease**: Certain [liver conditions](https://docus.ai/tags/liver) can cause the body to store too much iron.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\nIf iron levels are too high, here are some recommendations to manage and reduce iron levels naturally:\n\n- **Reduce Iron-Rich Foods**: Limit intake of red meat, liver, and iron-fortified cereals.\n- **Avoid Iron Supplements**: Do not take iron supplements unless prescribed by a doctor.\n- **Increase Calcium Intake**: Calcium can help block the absorption of iron.\n- **Donate Blood**: Blood donation can reduce the amount of stored iron in the body (consult a doctor first).\n- **Consult a Doctor**: For medical interventions such as therapeutic phlebotomy if iron levels remain dangerously high.\n\n### Iron Low Levels\n\nLow iron levels are usually a sign of iron deficiency, which can lead to anemia. This is a common condition that affects many people, especially women. The following are common causes of low iron levels:\n\n- **Blood Loss**: Chronic blood loss from conditions like heavy menstruation or gastrointestinal bleeding.\n- **Low Iron Intake**: A diet lacking in iron-rich foods like red meat, beans, and leafy greens.\n- **Increased Iron Needs**: Conditions like pregnancy or breastfeeding increase the body's demand for iron.\n- **Vitamin B12 Deficiency**: [Vitamin B12](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/vitamin-b12) is important for iron absorption.\n- **Chronic Diseases**: Conditions like Crohn’s disease or celiac disease can reduce iron absorption.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\nHere are practical tips to help boost low iron levels:\n\n- **Increase Iron-Rich Foods**: Eat more iron-rich foods like spinach, beans, lentils, red meat, and seafood.\n- **Pair with Vitamin C**: Foods high in vitamin C (like oranges and bell peppers) help your body absorb more iron.\n- **Avoid Certain Beverages**: Reduce tea and coffee intake with meals, as they can block iron absorption.\n- **Monitor Diet and Health**: Track your symptoms and regularly check iron levels, especially if you have a chronic condition.\n- **Consider Iron Supplements**: If recommended by a healthcare provider, take iron supplements to boost levels.\n\n### Which Specialist Should You Consult?\n\nIf your iron levels are too high or too low, it’s important to consult the appropriate healthcare provider. Here’s who you might see:\n\n- **General Practitioner (GP)**: Usually the first doctor to detect abnormal iron levels and manage mild cases.\n- **Hematologist**: A specialist who deals with blood disorders, including iron-deficiency anemia and iron overload conditions like hemochromatosis.\n- **Gastroenterologist**: If chronic diseases affecting iron absorption, such as Crohn’s or celiac disease, are suspected.\n\n#### Sources\n\nThis article was written by doctors from the Docus Medical Research team and reviewed by leading experts in hematology and gastroenterology.
