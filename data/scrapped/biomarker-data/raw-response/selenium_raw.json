The typical reference ranges for adults are:\n\n- **Blood Selenium Levels:** 150-241 ng/mL (nanograms per milliliter).\n- **Urine Selenium Levels:** 5.5 - 106 µg/L (micrograms per liter).\n\n**Note:** _The units of measurement and the normal ranges can differ depending on the laboratory and the specific methods used._\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## What Do Abnormal Levels Mean?\n\n### High Selenium Levels\n\nExcess selenium in the body can result from over-supplementation, excessive dietary intake, or environmental exposure. High selenium levels may lead to toxicity, causing various symptoms.\n\n**Possible causes of high selenium levels:**\n\n- **Overuse of Supplements:** Taking high doses of selenium supplements can cause toxicity.\n- **Dietary Excess:** Consuming large amounts of selenium-rich foods like Brazil nuts may lead to elevated levels.\n- **Occupational Exposure:** Industries like glass manufacturing, metalwork, and electronics may expose workers to high selenium levels.\n- **Medical Treatments:** Some treatments or dietary programs may lead to increased selenium intake.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\n- Reduce selenium-rich foods in the diet.\n- Stop or lower selenium supplement intake (under medical supervision).\n- Avoid occupational exposure by using protective equipment.\n- Drink plenty of water to aid selenium elimination through urine.\n- Seek medical advice if symptoms of toxicity appear.\n\n### Low Selenium Levels\n\nA deficiency in selenium can weaken immune function, slow metabolism, and increase the risk of certain diseases. Low levels often result from poor dietary intake or absorption issues.\n\n**Possible causes of low selenium levels:**\n\n- **Poor Diet:** Low intake of selenium-rich foods like seafood, nuts, and meat can lead to deficiency.\n- **Digestive Disorders:** Conditions like Crohn’s disease or celiac disease may impair selenium absorption.\n- **Chronic Illnesses:** Kidney disease and some cancers can reduce selenium levels in the body.\n- **Geographic Deficiency:** Some regions have selenium-poor soil, affecting the selenium content in locally grown foods.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\n- Include more selenium-rich foods such as seafood, meat, eggs, and Brazil nuts.\n- Consider selenium supplements if recommended by a healthcare professional.\n- Address underlying health conditions affecting mineral absorption.\n- Monitor selenium intake if living in a region with selenium-poor soil.\n\n### Which Specialist Should Be Consulted?\n\nIf selenium levels are abnormal, the appropriate specialist depends on the symptoms and underlying health concerns:\n\n- **Primary Care Doctor:** First point of contact for general selenium-related concerns.\n- **Endocrinologist:** If selenium imbalance affects thyroid function.\n- **Gastroenterologist:** If digestive issues impact selenium absorption.\n- **Toxicologist:** If selenium toxicity is suspected due to occupational exposure or overuse.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What does selenium do for the body?\n\nSelenium supports thyroid function, boosts the immune system, and acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Can selenium help with hair growth?\n\nAdequate selenium levels contribute to healthy hair by supporting scalp health and reducing oxidative stress that can affect hair follicles.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Does selenium affect mental health?\n\nSelenium plays a role in brain function and mood regulation. Low levels have been linked to increased risks of anxiety and depression.\n\nHave more questions?
