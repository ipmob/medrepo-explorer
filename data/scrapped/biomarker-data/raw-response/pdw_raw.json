Monitoring PDW levels can help detect and manage these conditions early.\n\nContents\n\n- [What Is PDW?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/pdw#what-is-pdw)\n- [When Is PDW Testing Recommended?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/pdw#when-is-pdw-testing-recommended)\n- [How Is PDW Testing Conducted?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/pdw#how-is-pdw-testing-conducted)\n- [What Are the Normal PDW Levels?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/pdw#what-are-the-normal-pdw-levels)\n- [What Do Abnormal Levels Mean?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/pdw#what-do-abnormal-levels-mean)\n\n## What Is PDW?\n\nPDW (Platelet Distribution Width) is expressed as a percentage and shows the **width of platelet distribution** by volume and their standard deviations in a blood sample. [Platelets](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/platelets), which are small cell fragments, are essential for blood clotting.\n\nBy analyzing PDW, healthcare providers can assess whether there is significant variation in platelet size, which may indicate various health conditions.\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## When Is PDW Testing Recommended?\n\nPDW is usually included as part of a CBC, which is often performed during an annual **general check-up**. It can also be specifically prescribed if there are symptoms that suggest **vascular diseases** or if **[cancer](https://docus.ai/tags/cancer)** is suspected. In these cases, PDW can help provide a clearer picture of the patient's condition.\n\n## How Is PDW Testing Conducted?\n\nPDW is a [blood test](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview) included in the [Complete Blood Count (CBC)](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/cbc-blood-test).\n\nPreparation for a PDW test is the same as for a general blood test. Typically, no special preparation is needed beyond the usual guidelines for blood testing, such as fasting if required by other tests being performed simultaneously.\n\n## What Are the Normal PDW Levels?\n\nFor adults, the standard PDW values range from **10% to 17.9%**. Staying within this range generally indicates that platelet size distribution is normal. Deviations from this range may warrant further medical evaluation.\n\n**Note** _: The units of measurement and the normal ranges can differ depending on the laboratory and the specific methods used._\n\n## What Do Abnormal Levels Mean?\n\n### PDW High Levels\n\nA high PDW level suggests that there is a significant variation in platelet size. This variation can be a marker for several serious health conditions, including:\n\n- **Vascular Diseases:** High PDW levels may indicate the presence of vascular diseases, which affect the blood vessels and can lead to complications such as atherosclerosis or thrombosis.\n- **Certain Types of Cancer:** Some cancers can cause irregular platelet production, leading to a higher PDW. This could be a sign that prompts further investigation.\n\nAn irregular PDW result typically requires additional research or testing to determine the underlying cause.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\n- **Consult a Hematologist**: Given the potential seriousness of high PDW levels, consulting a specialist is crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.\n- **Comprehensive Blood Tests**: Conducting further blood tests, including a complete blood count (CBC) and peripheral blood smear, can help identify specific abnormalities in platelet morphology.\n- **Monitor for Vascular Symptoms**: Patients should be monitored for symptoms related to vascular diseases, such as swelling, pain, or changes in skin color, which may require immediate medical attention.\n- **Consider Cancer Screening**: If cancer is suspected as a cause of high PDW, additional screening tests, such as imaging or biopsy, should be considered to identify any malignancies.\n- **Lifestyle Modifications**: Encourage patients to adopt heart-healthy lifestyle changes, such as diet modification, regular exercise, and smoking cessation, which may reduce vascular risks.\n\n### PDW Low Levels\n\nA low PDW level indicates that there is little variation in platelet size, which can also be associated with specific health conditions:\n\n- **Bone Marrow Disorders:** Low PDW levels may suggest a problem with bone marrow function, where platelets are produced. Conditions like aplastic anemia or bone marrow suppression can lead to low PDW.\n- **Chronic Inflammatory Conditions:** Some chronic inflammatory diseases can result in a consistent platelet size, reflected by a low PDW.\n\nLike high PDW levels, low PDW levels often necessitate further testing to uncover the root cause.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\n- **Bone Marrow Evaluation**: A bone marrow biopsy or aspiration may be necessary to determine if a bone marrow disorder is causing the low PDW level.\n- **Assess Inflammatory Markers**: Conduct tests to measure inflammatory markers (e.g., [CRP](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/crp), [ESR](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/erythrocyte-sedimentation-rate)) to evaluate for chronic inflammatory conditions that might be affecting platelet size.\n- **Regular Monitoring**: Patients with low PDW levels should undergo regular monitoring to track any changes in platelet size and count over time.\n- **Address Underlying Conditions**: Treatment should focus on managing the underlying disorder, whether it be a bone marrow condition or an inflammatory disease, to help normalize PDW levels.\n- **Nutritional Support**: Ensure adequate nutritional support, particularly with vitamins and minerals essential for bone marrow health, such as [vitamin B12](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/vitamin-b12), [folate](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/folate-blood-test), and [iron](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/iron).\n\n### Which Specialist Should You Consult?\n\nThe specialists most commonly involved in interpreting PDW results include:\n\n- **General Practitioner (GP):** The first point of contact for most patients, a GP can interpret PDW results and determine if further tests or specialist consultations are needed.\n- **Cardiologist:** If the PDW results suggest vascular disease, a cardiologist may be consulted for more in-depth analysis and treatment planning.\n\n#### Sources\n\nThis article was written by doctors from the Docus Medical Research team and reviewed by leading experts in cardiology.
