It helps the body break down **carbohydrates**, such as starch, into simple sugars that can be easily absorbed.\n\nThis enzyme is produced mainly in the **pancreas** and the salivary glands. While its primary function is to aid digestion, alpha-amylase is also used as a biomarker to help diagnose certain diseases and conditions. particularly those involving the pancreas or salivary glands.\n\nSince alpha-amylase can be found in multiple parts of the body, changes in its levels can indicate various medical issues, making it a useful tool in diagnosing health problems.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Your Personal AI Doctor\n\nCustomize your AI Doctor to ask any health-related questions. Get instant answers and tailored health insights.\n\n[Get Started](https://docus.ai/ai-doctor)\n\n## When Is Alpha-Amylase Testing Recommended?\n\nAlpha-amylase testing is usually recommended when doctors suspect a problem with your pancreas or salivary glands. The test helps to confirm or rule out conditions that may be causing certain symptoms. Below are some of the situations in which an alpha-amylase test may be prescribed:\n\n- **Severe upper abdominal pain**: Often a sign of a pancreatic disorder.\n- **Nausea and vomiting**: Could indicate issues related to digestion or inflammation of the pancreas.\n- **Loss of appetite**: Unexplained loss of appetite may be related to pancreatic or digestive problems.\n- **Fever**: This may occur when there is an infection or inflammation in the pancreas or salivary glands.\n- **Swollen salivary glands**: Can be a sign of infection or blockage, affecting amylase production.\n- **Suspected pancreatitis**: Alpha-amylase testing is a key diagnostic tool for acute or chronic pancreatitis.\n\n## How Is Alpha-Amylase Testing Conducted?\n\nAlpha-amylase testing is typically done through a [**blood test**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview). A small sample of blood is taken from a vein in your arm and sent to a laboratory for analysis. The test measures the amount of amylase in your bloodstream to help doctors understand whether your levels are within the normal range.\n\nIn some cases, a [**urine test**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/urinalysis-test#what-is-urinalysis) may also be conducted, as alpha-amylase can be measured in both blood and urine. Both methods are effective in detecting abnormal levels of amylase, but blood tests are more commonly used.\n\n**Test Preparations**\n\nBefore the test, your doctor may ask you to:\n\n- **Fast for a few hours** before the test, meaning you should not eat or drink anything except water.\n- **Avoid alcohol and certain medications** that may interfere with the results. Be sure to inform your doctor about any medications or supplements you are taking.\n\nNo other special preparations are generally required, but it’s always a good idea to follow your doctor’s specific instructions.\n\n**Special Preparations for Urine Test**\n\n- **Avoid Certain Foods**: Refrain from eating foods that may alter the color of your urine for at least 12 hours before sample collection. This includes items like blueberries, carrots, beetroot, and rhubarb.\n- **Stop Diuretics**: Discontinue taking diuretics 2 days before collecting your urine sample. Always consult with your doctor before stopping any medication.\n\n## What Are the Normal Alpha-Amylase Levels?\n\n### In Blood\n\nAlpha-amylase levels can vary based on age and pregnancy status. Below are the general reference ranges:\n\n**For Children**:\n\n- Up to 1 year old: 6–44 U/L\n- 1 to 3 years old: 8–79 U/L\n- 3 to 17 years old: 21–110 U/L\n\n**For Adults (Over 17 Years Old)**:\n\n- Standard Range: 28–100 U/L\n\n**For Pregnant Women**:\n\n- First Trimester: 24–83 U/L\n- Second Trimester: 16–73 U/L\n- Third Trimester: 15–81 U/L\n\n### In Urine\n\nUrine alpha-amylase levels can vary by gender:\n\n- **Adult Males**: 16–491 U/L\n- **Adult Females**: 21–447 U/L\n\n**Note**: _The units of measurement and the normal ranges can differ depending on the laboratory and the specific methods used._\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## What Do Abnormal Alpha-Amylase Levels Mean?\n\nChanges in alpha-amylase levels can indicate various health issues. Both high and low levels of amylase may point to specific conditions that require medical attention.\n\n### Alpha-Amylase High Levels\n\nHigh levels of alpha-amylase in the blood can be a sign of several medical conditions. These elevated levels usually suggest that there is an issue affecting either the pancreas or salivary glands.\n\nCommon causes of high alpha-amylase levels include:\n\n- **Acute pancreatitis**: Inflammation of the pancreas causes amylase levels to rise significantly.\n- **Swollen or infected salivary glands (mumps)**: Infection in the glands that produce saliva can lead to high amylase.\n- [**Kidney disease**](https://docus.ai/tags/kidney-diseases): The kidneys filter amylase from the blood, and if they are not functioning properly, amylase levels can build up.\n- **Pancreatic cancer**: Tumors in the pancreas can interfere with normal amylase production, leading to higher levels.\n- **Gallbladder inflammation**: Issues with the [gallbladder](https://docus.ai/tags/gallbladder) may indirectly affect amylase levels.\n\n#### Recommendations for Managing High Levels\n\nIf your alpha-amylase levels are high, your doctor will likely recommend the following steps to help manage your condition:\n\n- **Consult with a healthcare professional**: Work with your doctor to identify and treat the underlying cause of high amylase levels.\n- **Adopt a balanced diet**: Eating a healthy diet with low-fat foods can reduce strain on the pancreas.\n- **Stay hydrated**: Drinking plenty of water supports overall digestive health.\n- **Limit alcohol intake**: Excessive alcohol can harm the pancreas and worsen amylase levels.\n- **Follow up regularly**: Monitor your amylase levels with your doctor to track improvements.\n\n### Alpha-Amylase Low Levels\n\nLow levels of alpha-amylase can also indicate underlying health issues, typically involving long-term or chronic conditions. In some cases, low amylase is related to the pancreas no longer functioning correctly.\n\nCommon causes of low alpha-amylase levels include:\n\n- **Chronic pancreatitis**: Long-term inflammation of the pancreas can reduce its ability to produce amylase.\n- **Liver disease**: Conditions like cirrhosis or liver failure can result in lower amylase production.\n- **Cystic fibrosis**: This genetic disorder affects many organs, including the pancreas, leading to low amylase levels.\n\n#### Recommendations for Managing Low Levels\n\nIf you have low amylase levels, your doctor may suggest the following steps to improve your health:\n\n- **Lose weight**: If necessary, losing excess weight can reduce stress on your pancreas and digestive system.\n- **Avoid cigarette smoke**: Smoking can negatively affect your pancreas and digestive enzymes.\n- **Try a low-carb diet**: Reducing carbohydrate intake can ease the burden on your pancreas and help regulate amylase levels.\n- **Consult with your doctor**: Regular check-ups and monitoring are essential to managing the underlying conditions affecting your amylase levels.\n\n### Which Specialist Should You Consult?\n\nIf your alpha-amylase levels are abnormal, it’s important to seek the advice of a specialist to identify and manage the underlying cause. Depending on your specific condition, the following specialists may be recommended:\n\n- **Gastroenterologist**: Specializes in digestive system disorders, including the pancreas and salivary glands.\n- **Endocrinologist**: Focuses on the hormonal system, which can include pancreatic function.\n- **Nephrologist**: If kidney disease is suspected, a nephrologist may be consulted to manage kidney-related issues.\n\nThese specialists will help you understand the significance of your test results and develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs.\n\n#### Sources\n\nThis article was written by doctors from the Docus Medical Research team and reviewed by leading experts in gastroenterology, endocrinology, and nephrology.
