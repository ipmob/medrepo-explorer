Understanding their levels helps diagnose infections, inflammation, and other health conditions.\n\nContents\n\n- [What Are Epithelial Cells in Urine?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/epithelial-cells-in-urine#what-are-epithelial-cells-in-urine)\n- [When Is Epithelial Cell Testing Recommended?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/epithelial-cells-in-urine#when-is-epithelial-cell-testing-recommended)\n- [How Is Epithelial Cell Testing Conducted?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/epithelial-cells-in-urine#how-is-epithelial-cell-testing-conducted)\n- [What Are the Normal Epithelial Cell Levels?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/epithelial-cells-in-urine#what-are-the-normal-epithelial-cell-levels)\n- [What Do High Levels of Epithelial Cells in Urine Mean?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/epithelial-cells-in-urine#what-do-high-levels-of-epithelial-cells-in-urine-mean)\n\n## What Are Epithelial Cells in Urine?\n\n**Epithelial cells** are found on the surface of organs, skin, and various body structures, including the urinary tract. When these cells appear in urine, they can come from the **kidneys**, **bladder**, or **other parts of the urinary system**.\n\nThese cells are usually shed naturally. Having a small amount of epithelial cells in urine is normal. However, a high level may indicate underlying health issues.\n\nIn medicine, epithelial cells in urine serve as a biomarker. They help healthcare professionals detect various conditions. By examining these cells, doctors can gather information about infections, inflammation, or diseases affecting the kidneys or urinary tract.\n\nThe presence and type of epithelial cells— **squamous**, **transitional**, or **renal**—can help identify which area of the urinary tract may be affected. This information aids in accurate diagnosis and timely treatment.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Your Personal AI Doctor\n\nCustomize your AI Doctor to ask any health-related questions.

The test examines various components of urine, including epithelial cells, which are observed under a microscope to determine their type and quantity. Here’s how the testing process generally works:\n\n1. **Urine Sample Collection**: Patients are asked to provide a clean urine sample. Typically, a \"midstream\" collection method is recommended, where the first few drops are not collected, helping reduce contaminants.\n2. **Microscopic Analysis**: In the lab, the urine sample is examined under a microscope to identify and count the number of epithelial cells. This process reveals the type of cells present, which can help indicate where they may have come from in the urinary tract.\n3. **Types of Tests Involving Epithelial Cells**: Epithelial cell count is a standard part of a complete urinalysis, which also checks for white and red blood cells, protein levels, and other markers of health.\n\n**Preparation Tips**:\n\n- Clean the genital area before collecting the urine sample to minimize contamination.\n- Avoid testing during menstruation, as it can affect the results.\n- Follow any specific guidelines given by the healthcare provider, such as fasting or avoiding certain foods or drinks.\n\n## What Are the Normal Epithelial Cell Levels?\n\nFor adults, the typical range for epithelial cells in urine is **0-55 units/mcL**.\n\n**Note:** _The units of measurement and the normal ranges can differ depending on the laboratory and the specific methods used._\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## What Do High Levels of Epithelial Cells in Urine Mean?\n\nWhen the level of epithelial cells in urine is elevated, it may signal various health conditions. Different types of epithelial cells, such as squamous, transitional, or renal, can suggest specific areas of concern within the urinary tract. Here are some potential causes:\n\n- **Kidney Infections or Inflammation**: High levels of renal epithelial cells could indicate kidney infections or other forms of kidney inflammation.\n- [**Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)**](https://docus.ai/tags/uti): A high count of transitional epithelial cells may be linked to infections affecting the bladder or urinary tract.\n- **Kidney Diseases**: Conditions like glomerulonephritis or tubular necrosis often result in increased renal epithelial cells, which signal damage to the kidneys.\n- **Bladder Conditions**: Transitional cells may increase due to bladder infections, polyps, or even bladder cancer.\n- **Physical Injury**: Trauma to the urinary tract, whether from catheter use or another form of injury, can elevate epithelial cell levels.\n\n### Recommendations\n\nIf your results show high levels of epithelial cells, here are some steps you can take to support your urinary health:\n\n- **Stay Hydrated**: Drinking plenty of water helps flush out bacteria and toxins from the urinary tract.\n- **Practice Good Hygiene**: Ensure cleanliness, especially around the genital area, to reduce the risk of infections.\n- **Limit Certain Foods**: Some foods, like caffeine and alcohol, can irritate the bladder. Reducing their intake may benefit urinary health.\n- **Avoid Holding Urine**: Regularly emptying your bladder can help prevent infections.\n- **Follow Medical Advice**: Always adhere to the guidance provided by your healthcare provider, particularly if they recommend further tests or treatment.\n\n### Which Specialist Should You Consult?\n\nFor elevated levels of epithelial cells in your urine, consult a healthcare provider who can guide you based on the underlying cause. Here are some specialists you may consider:\n\n- **General Practitioner**: Often the first point of contact for general health issues and routine testing.\n- **Urologist**: Specializes in diseases of the urinary tract and can handle complex cases.\n- **Nephrologist**: Focuses on kidney health and is essential if there’s a possibility of kidney disease.\n- **Infectious Disease Specialist**: If an infection is suspected, particularly if it's persistent or unusual.\n\nEach specialist has a different approach, and they can work together if necessary to ensure a comprehensive assessment and treatment plan for your condition.\n\n#### Sources\n\nThis article was written by doctors from the Docus Medical Research team and reviewed by leading urology experts.
