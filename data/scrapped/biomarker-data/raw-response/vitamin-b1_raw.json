It helps convert **carbohydrates** into energy, supports the nervous system, and maintains heart health.\n\nThis vitamin is vital for nerve signal transmission, muscle contraction, and [glucose](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/glucose) metabolism. Since the body cannot produce vitamin B1, it must be obtained from food sources such as whole grains, nuts, seeds, beans, and seafood.\n\nThiamine testing can help diagnose deficiencies or conditions linked to abnormal thiamine metabolism, such as certain neurological and cardiovascular disorders.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Your Personal AI Doctor\n\nCustomize your AI Doctor to ask any health-related questions.

Testing may be prescribed in cases such as:\n\n- **Persistent fatigue or weakness:** To check if a lack of vitamin B1 is contributing to low energy levels.\n- **Numbness or tingling in the hands and feet:** These symptoms may indicate nerve damage due to thiamine deficiency.\n- **Irritability, memory loss, or confusion:** Vitamin B1 deficiency can affect brain function, leading to cognitive symptoms.\n- **Heart problems:** Symptoms like shortness of breath, swollen legs, or irregular heartbeat may prompt testing.\n- **Chronic alcoholism:** Excessive alcohol consumption can interfere with thiamine absorption, increasing the risk of deficiency.\n- **Malabsorption syndromes:** Conditions that impair nutrient absorption, like Crohn’s disease, may require monitoring of vitamin B1 levels.\n\n## How Is Vitamin B1 Testing Conducted?\n\nVitamin B1 is typically measured using a [blood test](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview). A venous blood sample is collected to evaluate thiamine levels.\n\nThiamine is often included in broader health panels, such as:\n\n- [Nutritional panels](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/nutritional-tests)\n- Micronutrient assessments\n\n**Preparation for the Test**\n\nSpecial preparation is usually not required, but avoiding vitamin supplements for 48 hours before the test is recommended. This ensures the results reflect actual dietary intake and body stores.\n\n## What Are the Normal Vitamin B1 Levels?\n\nNormal vitamin B1 levels for adults typically range between **70-180 nmol/L**.\n\n**Note:** _The units of measurement and the normal ranges can differ depending on the laboratory and the specific methods used._\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## What Do Low Levels Mean?\n\nLow vitamin B1 levels are common and can lead to severe health issues if untreated. Causes include:\n\n- **Poor dietary intake:** Diets lacking whole grains, nuts, or seeds can result in deficiency.\n- **Excessive alcohol consumption:** Alcohol interferes with thiamine absorption and utilization.\n- **Malabsorption disorders:** Conditions like celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease impair nutrient absorption.\n- **Increased need for thiamine:** Pregnancy, lactation, or high physical activity levels may increase thiamine requirements.\n- **Chronic illnesses:** Long-term illnesses such as [diabetes](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/diabetes) can deplete vitamin B1 stores.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n- Increase intake of thiamine-rich foods, such as whole grains, nuts, and beans.\n- Avoid alcohol to improve nutrient absorption.\n- Maintain a healthy, balanced diet with sufficient caloric intake.\n- Consider thiamine supplementation, as advised by your healthcare provider.\n\n### Which Specialist Should You Consult?\n\nIf you suspect a vitamin B1 imbalance, consult the following specialists:\n\n- **General Physician**: For initial evaluation and recommendations.\n- **Hematologist**: If blood-related issues are suspected.\n- **Endocrinologist**: For underlying conditions affecting nutrient absorption.\n- **Neurologist**: If neurological symptoms, like numbness or confusion, are present.\n- **Dietitian**: To create a personalized diet plan for managing thiamine levels.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Can Vitamin B1 deficiency affect mental health?\n\nYes, Vitamin B1 deficiency can impact mental health by causing symptoms like memory loss, irritability, and even confusion in severe cases.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Is it possible to get too much Vitamin B1 from food?\n\nNo, it's extremely rare to consume excessive Vitamin B1 from food, as it is water-soluble and excess amounts are excreted.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Does Vitamin B1 affect blood pressure?\n\nVitamin B1 may help regulate blood pressure by improving cardiovascular function. Deficiency could lead to heart-related issues, indirectly affecting blood pressure.\n\nHave more questions?
