Understanding ferritin is crucial for maintaining overall health.\n\nContents\n\n- [What Is Ferritin?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/ferritin#what-is-ferritin)\n- [When Is Ferritin Testing Recommended?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/ferritin#when-is-ferritin-testing-recommended)\n- [How Is Ferritin Testing Conducted?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/ferritin#how-is-ferritin-testing-conducted)\n- [What Are the Normal Ferritin Levels?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/ferritin#what-are-the-normal-ferritin-levels)\n- [What Do Abnormal Levels Mean?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/ferritin#what-do-abnormal-levels-mean)\n\n## What Is Ferritin?\n\nFerritin is a protein in your body that stores iron. It acts like a storage container, holding extra iron until your body needs it. [Iron](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/iron) supports red blood cell production, growth, and a healthy metabolism.\n\nDoctors check ferritin levels through a blood test to see if you have too much or too little iron, which can affect your energy, immune system, and overall health.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Your Personal AI Doctor\n\nCustomize your AI Doctor to ask any health-related questions. Get instant answers and tailored health insights.\n\n[Get Started](https://docus.ai/ai-doctor)\n\n## When Is Ferritin Testing Recommended?\n\nFerritin testing helps identify abnormal iron storage, which can cause various health problems. Doctors may recommend the test in the following situations:\n\n- **Persistent fatigue or weakness** to check for iron deficiency anemia.\n- **Shortness of breath** or symptoms related to low oxygen levels in the blood.\n- **Pale or yellowish skin** as a possible sign of iron-related issues.\n- **Unexplained weight loss** to investigate underlying conditions.\n- **Irregular heartbeat** or chest discomfort linked to anemia.\n- **Hair loss** as a symptom of potential iron deficiency.\n- **Frequent infections** that might indicate a compromised immune system due to low iron.\n- **Symptoms of chronic diseases** like rheumatoid arthritis, which can impact iron levels.\n\n## How Is Ferritin Testing Conducted?\n\nFerritin is measured through a simple [blood test](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview).\n\nA healthcare provider draws a small sample from a vein, usually in the arm. This sample is analyzed to determine ferritin levels and assess iron storage.\n\nTests that may include ferritin levels:\n\n- [**Complete Blood Count (CBC)**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/cbc-blood-test) **:** Examines overall blood health and detects anemia.\n- [**Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/metabolic-panel#types-of-metabolic-panels-bmp-and-cmp) **:** Provides information on organ function and overall health.\n- **Iron Panel:** Specifically measures ferritin and other markers of iron metabolism.\n\n**Special Preparations for the Test:**\n\n- Avoid eating for at least 8 hours before the test. Drinking water is allowed.\n- Refrain from alcohol consumption 24 hours before testing.\n- Avoid physical and emotional stress 30 minutes before the test.\n- Do not smoke 30 minutes before the test.\n\n## What Are the Normal Ferritin Levels?\n\nFerritin levels vary by age, sex, and specific conditions such as pregnancy. Below are the standard reference ranges:\n\n**Children**\n\n- Up to 1 year old: 8–182 ng/mL\n- Up to 4 years old: 5–100 ng/mL\n- Up to 13 years old: 14–79 ng/mL\n- Up to 15 years old: 13–83 ng/mL\n- Up to 18 years old: 11–172 ng/mL\n\n**Adults**\n\n- **Males:**\n  - Up to 59 years old: 38–380 ng/mL\n  - Over 59 years old: 24–380 ng/mL\n- **Females:**\n  - Up to 40 years old: 16–154 ng/mL\n  - Up to 60 years old: 16–232 ng/mL\n  - Over 60 years old: 16–288 ng/mL\n\n**Pregnant Women**\n\n- First trimester: 6–130 ng/mL\n- Second trimester: 2–230 ng/mL\n- Third trimester: 0–116 ng/mL\n\n**Note:** _The units of measurement and the normal ranges may differ depending on the laboratory and specific testing methods._\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## What Do Abnormal Levels Mean?\n\n### Ferritin High Levels\n\nElevated ferritin levels may indicate excessive iron storage or other health conditions. Common causes include:\n\n- **Liver diseases:** Such as cirrhosis, which affects iron metabolism.\n- **Hemochromatosis:** A genetic disorder causing iron overload.\n- **Chronic inflammation or autoimmune disorders:** These can increase ferritin as part of the body's response.\n- **Frequent blood transfusions:** Excess iron from transfusions can raise levels.\n- **Certain cancers:** Like Hodgkin's lymphoma or leukemia.\n- **Excessive iron supplementation:** Overuse of iron tablets or injections.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\n- Work with your doctor to determine the underlying cause.\n- Avoid iron-rich foods and supplements unless directed by a doctor.\n- Maintain a healthy body weight to reduce inflammation.\n- Refrain from smoking and excessive alcohol consumption.\n\n### Ferritin Low Levels\n\nLow ferritin often signals a lack of iron in the body, leading to insufficient [red blood cell](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/rdw-blood-test) production. Common causes include:\n\n- **Iron-deficient diet:** Inadequate intake of iron-rich foods.\n- **Poor absorption:** Conditions like celiac disease or certain medications can hinder iron absorption.\n- [**Heavy menstrual bleeding**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/8-types-of-abnormal-menstruation) **:** This can significantly lower iron stores.\n- **Chronic blood loss:** From ulcers or gastrointestinal issues.\n- **Iron deficiency anemia:** A common outcome of prolonged low ferritin levels.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\n- Increase intake of iron-rich foods, such as lean meats, leafy greens, and legumes.\n- Pair iron-rich foods with vitamin C to enhance absorption.\n- Address any underlying health issues causing blood loss or poor absorption.\n- Follow your doctor’s guidance on iron supplementation if necessary.\n\n### Which Specialist Should You Consult?\n\nFor abnormal ferritin levels, consult the following specialists:\n\n- **Primary care physician:** For initial evaluation and general management.\n- **Hematologist:** If ferritin levels suggest blood disorders or anemia.\n- **Gastroenterologist:** If the issue involves poor iron absorption or gastrointestinal bleeding.\n- **Endocrinologist:** For hormonal or metabolic conditions impacting ferritin.\n\n#### Sources\n\nThis article was written by doctors from the Docus Medical Research team and reviewed by leading hematology experts.
