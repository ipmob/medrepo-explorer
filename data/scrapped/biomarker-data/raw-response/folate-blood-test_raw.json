It is essential for producing and repairing **DNA** and **RNA** and is involved in amino acid metabolism, which is necessary for proper cell function.\n\nFolate also supports the production of red and white blood cells in the bone marrow and aids in converting carbohydrates into energy.\n\nFor pregnant women, folate is vital for the healthy development of the fetus, particularly in preventing neural tube defects.\n\nSince **the body cannot produce folate**, it must be obtained through diet or supplements.\n\nA lack of folate can lead to various health problems, such as certain types of **anemia** and **pregnancy complications**.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Your Personal AI Doctor\n\nCustomize your AI Doctor to ask any health-related questions. Get instant answers and tailored health insights.\n\n[Get Started](https://docus.ai/ai-doctor)\n\n## When Is Folate Testing Recommended?\n\nFolate testing is typically recommended to check for deficiencies or to monitor certain conditions. It helps in diagnosing underlying causes of various symptoms and conditions related to folate imbalance.\n\nYour doctor might recommend folate testing in the following situations:\n\n- **Diagnosing anemia:** Folate tests help distinguish between different types of anemia, especially megaloblastic anemia.\n- **Pregnancy planning:** To ensure that folate levels are adequate for fetal development.\n- **Nutritional deficiencies:** For individuals with poor diets or those on restrictive eating plans.\n- **Gastrointestinal disorders:** To evaluate folate absorption in conditions affecting the digestive system.\n- **Monitoring treatment:** For patients undergoing treatments that may affect folate levels.\n- **Symptoms of fatigue or weakness:** These symptoms could signal a possible folate deficiency.\n\n## How Is Folate Testing Conducted?\n\nFolate levels are most commonly measured through a [blood test](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview). A sample of venous blood is taken to evaluate the amount of folate in your serum or red blood cells.\n\nIn certain cases, doctors may also test folate levels through [urine](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/urinalysis-test), but blood tests are more common.\n\nTest types that include folate measurement:\n\n- **Serum folate test:** Measures the amount of folate circulating in the blood at the time of the test.\n\n**Special preparations for the test:**\n\n- Fasting is often required for at least 8 hours before the test to get accurate results.\n- Avoid taking supplements or medications containing folate for a few days prior to the test, as this can affect the readings.\n\n## What Are the Normal Folate Levels?\n\nIn adults, normal folate levels typically range between **12.46-61.18 nmol/L**.\n\n**Note** _: The units of measurement and the normal ranges can differ depending on the laboratory and the specific methods used_\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## What Do Abnormal Folate Levels Mean?\n\nAbnormal folate levels can either be too high or too low, each presenting different causes and health implications.\n\n### Folate High Levels\n\nHigh levels of folate are usually less common.\n\nCauses of high folate levels:\n\n- **Excess dietary intake:** Consuming large amounts of folic acid through fortified foods or supplements.\n- **Metabolic disorders:** Conditions affecting folate metabolism can cause increased levels in the blood.\n- **Certain vegetarian diets:** A diet rich in folate-containing vegetables, especially without sufficient protein intake, can lead to higher folate levels.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\n- Discuss your diet with a healthcare provider to adjust folate intake if necessary.\n- Avoid taking unnecessary supplements unless prescribed by your doctor.\n- Monitor your overall health, as high folate levels may indicate other issues that need attention.\n\n### Folate Low Levels\n\nLow folate levels are more common and can result from a variety of factors. These deficiencies can lead to anemia, pregnancy complications, and other health issues.\n\nCauses of low folate levels:\n\n- **[Pregnancy](https://docus.ai/tags/pregnancy):** Increased demand for folate during pregnancy can lead to deficiencies if not supplemented.\n- **Excessive alcohol consumption:** Alcohol interferes with the absorption and storage of folate in the body.\n- **Poor diet:** Lack of folate-rich foods like leafy greens can cause deficiency.\n- **Gastrointestinal diseases:** Conditions like Crohn’s disease or celiac disease impair the absorption of folate.\n- **Liver or kidney disease:** These conditions may affect the body’s ability to process and store folate.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\n- Increase folate intake through diet by consuming foods like leafy greens, legumes, and citrus fruits.\n- Reduce or eliminate alcohol consumption, as it can contribute to folate deficiency.\n- Consult with your doctor to determine if folate supplements are needed.\n- Work with a healthcare provider to treat any underlying conditions that may be causing low folate levels.\n\n### Which Specialist Should You Consult?\n\nIf you have concerns about your folate levels or related health issues, you should consider consulting the following specialists:\n\n- **Family doctor:** For general health concerns and initial testing.\n- **Gastroenterologist:** If gastrointestinal issues are affecting folate absorption.\n- **Nutritionist:** For advice on dietary changes and proper nutrition.\n- **Hematologist:** If anemia or blood disorders are suspected.\n- **Gynecologist:** For pregnancy-related concerns about folate levels.\n- **Pediatrician:** If the patient is a child with possible folate deficiency.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Is folic acid the same as folate?\n\nFolic acid and folate are related but not the same. Folate is the natural form of Vitamin B9 found in foods, while folic acid is the synthetic version used in supplements and fortified foods.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Can high folate levels be linked to cancer?\n\nWhile there is no direct evidence that high folate levels cause cancer, some studies suggest that excessive folic acid supplementation may potentially influence the growth of certain types of cancer cells. Always consult a healthcare provider before taking large amounts of folic acid.\n\nHave more questions?
