PCR is highly accurate and can detect even small amounts of the virus, making it the gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19.\n\nPCR tests are essential for identifying active infections, monitoring outbreaks, and preventing the spread of the disease.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Your Personal AI Doctor\n\nCustomize your AI Doctor to ask any health-related questions.

Testing may be prescribed in the following situations:\n\n- **To diagnose COVID-19 symptoms:** Fever, cough, [sore throat](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/sore-throat-covid), shortness of breath, or other related symptoms.\n- **After close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient:** Especially within the last 14 days.\n- **For travelers:** Arriving from areas with high rates of infection.\n- **Routine testing for healthcare and social workers:** To ensure they are not asymptomatic carriers.\n- **Before medical procedures:** To rule out active infection.\n- **As part of outbreak control measures:** To monitor clusters of cases.\n\n## How Is a PCR COVID Test Conducted?\n\nA PCR COVID test collects a sample from the upper respiratory tract using a **nasopharyngeal** or **oropharyngeal [swab](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/swab-test)**. This means a soft swab is inserted into the nose or throat to collect mucus.\n\nThe sample is then analyzed in a lab using PCR technology to amplify the virus's RNA.\n\nThis sensitive method increases the virus's genetic material, allowing even tiny amounts to be detected.\n\nSome [at-home test kits](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/home-otc-covid-19-diagnostic-tests) are also available, allowing individuals to collect samples themselves and either process them at home or send them to a lab for analysis.\n\n![covid at home test kit](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2F97fe370dc5ea000a0ce54b7997fa737e.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n### Test Preparation\n\n- Avoid eating, drinking, or smoking at least **3 hours before the test**.\n- Refrain from gargling or rinsing your mouth and throat before sampling.\n- Inform your healthcare provider if you have used nasal sprays or other medications.\n\n## What Do the Results Mean?\n\nThe PCR COVID test results are typically reported as:\n\n- **Detected:** Indicates the presence of the virus, meaning an active infection or carrier state.\n- **Not detected:** Suggests no active infection or a negative result.\n\n**Note:** _Some labs may use different terms like \"positive/negative\" or \"present/absent,\" but the interpretation remains the same._\n\nFor at-home test kits, results are usually displayed as:\n\n- **Positive**: Two lines appear, one in the control (C) region and one in the test (T) region, indicating a likely infection.\n- **Negative**: Only one line appears in the control (C) region, indicating no infection.\n- **Invalid**: No line or a line only in the test (T) region suggests an error, and the test should be repeated.\n\nAt-home test kits provide a quick and convenient way to check for COVID-19, but confirmatory testing, such as PCR, may be recommended in some cases.\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## What Does Detection of Coronavirus RNA Mean?\n\nA detected result from a PCR COVID test confirms the presence of the virus. This can occur in the following scenarios:\n\n- **Active COVID-19 infection:** Symptoms may range from mild to severe, depending on the stage of the disease.\n- **Asymptomatic carrier status:** The virus is present, but there are no symptoms, increasing the risk of spreading it to others.\n- **False positives:** Rare but possible, often due to contamination or cross-reactivity during the testing process.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n- **Follow isolation guidelines:** To avoid transmitting the virus.\n- **Consult a healthcare provider:** For further advice and symptom management.\n- **Notify close contacts:** To encourage them to monitor for symptoms and get tested.\n- **Adhere to treatments:** If prescribed by your doctor.\n\n### Which Specialist Should You Consult?\n\nIf your PCR COVID test result is positive, you may need to consult:\n\n- **General practitioners:** For initial symptoms or general advice.\n- **Infectious disease specialists:** For advanced care or complex cases.\n- **Critical care specialists:** For severe or life-threatening infections requiring intensive treatment.\n\nAlways follow the guidance of a healthcare professional to ensure proper care and timely diagnosis.\n\n#### Sources\n\nThis article was written by doctors from the Docus Medical Research team and reviewed by leading infectious diseases experts.
