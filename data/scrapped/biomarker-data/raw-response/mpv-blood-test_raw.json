[Platelets](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/platelets) are small cells that help your blood clot, stopping bleeding when you get injured. MPV gives doctors more information about your platelets, showing whether they are larger or smaller than usual. This measurement is often used to help diagnose or monitor certain blood-related conditions, like blood disorders or diseases affecting your bone marrow, where platelets are made.\n\nIt can be especially useful in diagnosing issues such as clotting disorders, inflammatory diseases, or certain [cancers](https://docus.ai/tags/cancer).\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## When Is MPV Testing Recommended?\n\nDoctors may order an MPV test when they suspect certain blood-related problems. It can help them understand what's happening with your platelets and overall blood health. This test is often recommended if you have symptoms or conditions such as:\n\n- **Prolonged or unusual bleeding:** If you bleed for a long time after an injury or have frequent nosebleeds.\n- **Unexplained bruising:** Bruising that appears without any known cause.\n- **Red or purplish spots on the skin:** These spots can be a sign of platelet problems.\n- **Vitamin D deficiency symptoms:** Like [fatigue](https://docus.ai/tags/fatigue), muscle weakness, or brittle bones.\n- **Symptoms of blood disorders:** If a doctor suspects you may have a blood disorder based on other symptoms or conditions.\n\n## How Is MPV Testing Conducted?\n\nMPV is measured through a [**blood test**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview). It is part of a [**Complete Blood Count (CBC)**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/cbc-blood-test) test, which counts and measures different cells in your blood, including platelets.\n\nThe MPV test uses a technology called **electrical impedance** (Coulter Principle), where a sample of whole blood passes through a narrow passage between two electrodes. As each blood cell passes through the electrodes, the test measures the change in electrical resistance, which tells how big the platelets are.\n\n**Test Preparation:**\n\n- **Fasting:** You should not eat for 8 hours before the test, but drinking water is allowed.\n- **Avoid alcohol:** Do not drink alcohol for 24 hours before the test.\n- **No smoking or stress:** Avoid smoking and try to relax for at least 30 minutes before the test.\n\n## What Are the Normal MPV Levels?\n\nFor adults, normal MPV levels usually range between **7.5 to 11.5 fL**.\n\n**Note** _: The units of measurement and the normal ranges can differ depending on the laboratory and the specific methods used_\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## What Do Abnormal MPV Levels Mean?\n\n### MPV High Levels\n\nHigh MPV means that your platelets are larger than usual. This could be a sign that your body is making too many platelets or that they are being produced quickly to replace those lost due to certain conditions. Some common causes of high MPV include:\n\n- **Smoking:** Smoking can affect blood and platelet production.\n- **High altitudes:** Your body may produce more platelets at higher altitudes due to lower oxygen levels.\n- **Vitamin D deficiency:** A lack of vitamin D can cause high MPV, leading to symptoms like fatigue or bone weakness.\n- **Obesity:** Excess weight can affect the production of platelets.\n- [**Thyroid issues**](https://docus.ai/tags/thyroid-issues) **:** Both overactive and underactive thyroid glands (hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism) can cause high MPV.\n- **Certain cancers:** MPV may be elevated in people with cancers such as lung, breast, ovarian, stomach, or colon cancer.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\n- **Quit smoking:** Stopping smoking can help normalize platelet production.\n- **Improve vitamin D levels:** Sunlight exposure and vitamin D-rich foods can help manage deficiency.\n- **Manage weight:** Keeping a healthy weight can reduce high MPV caused by obesity.\n- **Follow doctor’s advice:** Addressing underlying health issues like thyroid problems or cancer is key to managing high MPV.\n\n### MPV Low Levels\n\nLow MPV means that your platelets are smaller than average. This could suggest that your body is not producing enough platelets or that the platelets are older and smaller. Some common causes of low MPV include:\n\n- **Rheumatoid arthritis:** This [autoimmune disorder](https://docus.ai/tags/autoimmune-diseases) can cause low platelet production.\n- **Lupus:** Another autoimmune disease that can affect platelets and lead to lower MPV.\n- **Inflammatory bowel disease:** Conditions like Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis may lead to low MPV.\n- **Aplastic anemia:** A condition where the bone marrow doesn’t produce enough new blood cells, including platelets.\n- **Chemotherapy:** Treatments for cancer can lower MPV by reducing bone marrow activity.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\n- **Treat underlying conditions:** Managing autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus can help normalize MPV.\n- **Follow medical treatment:** If you are undergoing chemotherapy or have aplastic [anemia](https://docus.ai/tags/anemia), your doctor may suggest treatments to boost bone marrow activity.\n- **Maintain a balanced diet:** Eating a diet rich in nutrients can support overall blood health.\n\n### Which Specialist Should You Consult?\n\nIf you receive abnormal MPV test results, your doctor may recommend seeing a specialist based on the underlying condition causing the abnormal levels. You may need to consult:\n\n- **Hematologist:** For blood disorders or platelet problems.\n- **Endocrinologist:** If your MPV is affected by thyroid or hormonal issues.\n- **Oncologist:** If cancer is suspected to be the cause of abnormal MPV levels.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What is MPV in a blood test and why is it important?\n\nMean Platelet Volume (MPV) in a blood test measures the average size of platelets in your blood. It provides important information about your platelet production and can help detect conditions like blood disorders, vitamin deficiencies, and cancers.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What does high MPV mean in a blood test?\n\nHigh MPV means your platelets are larger than normal, which could be a sign of increased production due to conditions such as vitamin D deficiency, obesity, or even certain cancers. It’s important to consult your doctor for further diagnosis.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What causes low MPV in a blood test?\n\nLow MPV indicates smaller platelets, which could suggest bone marrow issues or conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or anemia. Chemotherapy treatments can also result in low MPV levels.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Is high MPV in a blood test always a sign of serious health problems?\n\nNot necessarily. High MPV can be linked to several factors like smoking, high altitudes, or thyroid disorders. However, it can also indicate more serious conditions, so it's essential to follow up with a healthcare professional.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What can I do if my MPV is low?\n\nLow MPV can be managed by addressing the underlying cause, such as treating autoimmune diseases, improving nutrition, or following prescribed treatments for anemia or other conditions. Consult your doctor for a personalized approach.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Should I be concerned if my MPV is high?\n\nA high MPV result should be evaluated along with other blood test results. In some cases, it may indicate health problems like cancer or thyroid issues, but in others, it might be related to more manageable factors like vitamin D deficiency or smoking.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# How is MPV related to my overall health?\n\nMPV gives insight into your platelet function, which plays a crucial role in blood clotting. Abnormal MPV levels can signal health problems that might require further investigation and management.\n\nHave more questions?
