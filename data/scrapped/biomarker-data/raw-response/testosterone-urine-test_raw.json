It supports reproductive development, muscle growth, bone density, and energy levels.\n\nIn healthcare, a testosterone urine test helps diagnose hormonal imbalances or disorders. By analyzing testosterone in urine, doctors can gather information on testosterone production, especially when evaluating conditions like infertility, adrenal dysfunction, or early or delayed puberty.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Your Personal AI Doctor\n\nCustomize your AI Doctor to ask any health-related questions. Get instant answers and tailored health insights.\n\n[Get Started](https://docus.ai/ai-doctor)\n\n## When Is a Testosterone Urine Test Recommended?\n\nDoctors may recommend a testosterone urine test to understand hormone production levels and identify hormonal imbalances. Here are some common reasons for testing:\n\n- When puberty appears to be either early or delayed\n- To support treatment with hormone-based medications\n- To evaluate testosterone metabolism in both men and women\n- To detect congenital or acquired dysfunctions of the adrenal cortex\n- When diagnosing adrenal hyperandrogenism, especially in women\n- In cases where conception has been challenging or for infertility assessments\n- For evaluating hormonal imbalances in people with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\n- When a hormone-producing tumor is suspected in the adrenal cortex\n\n## How Is a Testosterone Urine Test Conducted?\n\nA testosterone urine test is typically performed using **a 24-hour urine sample**. This type of sample is essential because hormone levels can vary throughout the day, so collecting all urine over a 24-hour period provides a more accurate average level. The collected sample is then analyzed to measure testosterone levels.\n\nTestosterone can also be measured through a [blood test](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview), which is commonly used to check testosterone levels directly in the bloodstream. Doctors may choose a urine or blood test depending on the specific information they need about hormone production and balance.\n\n**Preparing for the Test**\n\nSome preparations are essential to ensure accurate results:\n\n- **Avoid medications with testosterone**: Testosterone supplements or medications containing hormones should be stopped, as advised by the doctor, to avoid skewed results.\n- **Follow doctor’s guidelines**: Certain foods or activities may need to be avoided before testing, so it's essential to follow any specific instructions given by the healthcare provider.\n- **Plan for a full 24-hour sample**: Since this test requires collecting urine over a day, it may be helpful to plan for any adjustments in your routine.\n\n## What Are the Normal Testosterone Urine Test Levels?\n\nThe normal range for testosterone levels in a urine test can differ between men and women:\n\n- **Males**: 20-170 micrograms per 24 hours\n- **Females**: 5-38 micrograms per 24 hours\n\n**Note:** _The units of measurement and the normal ranges can differ depending on the laboratory and the specific methods used._\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## What Do Abnormal Levels Mean?\n\n### Testosterone High Levels\n\nHigh testosterone levels in a urine test may indicate an excess production of the hormone due to underlying health issues or other influences. Possible causes include:\n\n- **Early Puberty**: In cases where puberty starts earlier than usual, hormone production, including testosterone, may increase.\n- **Certain Medications**: Some treatments and medications can lead to elevated testosterone as a side effect.\n- **Low Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG)**: Low SHBG levels can increase free testosterone in the bloodstream, affecting urine levels.\n- **Hyperthyroidism**: An overactive thyroid can sometimes result in higher testosterone production.\n- **Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia**: This genetic condition affects the adrenal glands, often increasing androgen production, including testosterone.\n- **Cushing’s Disease or Syndrome**: This disorder leads to high cortisol production, which can impact androgen levels, raising testosterone.\n- **Adrenogenital Syndrome**: This condition affects the adrenal glands, sometimes causing excess testosterone.\n- [**Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/pcos-overview): Women with PCOS often experience elevated testosterone due to hormonal imbalances.\n- **Certain Tumors**: Tumors in the testicles, ovaries, or adrenal glands can produce extra testosterone, raising levels in urine.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\nTo help manage high testosterone levels, consider these lifestyle changes and tips:\n\n- **Regular Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help balance hormone levels naturally.\n- **Healthy Diet**: Foods high in fiber, healthy fats, and antioxidants support balanced hormones, while processed sugars, trans fats, and excessive alcohol are [foods that lower testosterone](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/testosterone-killing-foods). Reducing these may help maintain healthier levels.\n- **Stress Reduction**: Chronic stress impacts hormone levels, so practices like meditation, yoga, and deep breathing exercises can help.\n- **Follow Medical Advice**: If your doctor prescribes treatment, follow their instructions carefully for optimal management of hormone levels.\n\n### Testosterone Low Levels\n\nLow levels in a testosterone urine test can result from several different health conditions and lifestyle factors. Here are some potential causes:\n\n- **Obesity in Men**: Extra body fat can lead to lower testosterone levels in men, affecting hormone metabolism.\n- **Chronic Prostatitis**: Long-term inflammation of the prostate can impact testosterone levels in men.\n- **Certain Medications**: Some drugs can interfere with testosterone production or lower levels as a side effect.\n- **Adrenal Insufficiency**: When the adrenal glands do not produce enough hormones, testosterone levels may drop.\n- **Hypothalamic or Pituitary Disorders**: Problems in these areas of the brain can impact hormone regulation, leading to lower testosterone.\n- **Hypogonadism**: A condition where the gonads produce insufficient sex hormones, affecting testosterone levels.\n- **Impaired Gonadotropic Hormones**: Disruptions in hormones produced by the pituitary gland can lead to lower testosterone.\n- **Klinefelter Syndrome**: This genetic disorder can cause lower testosterone levels, especially in men.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\nFor managing low testosterone levels, these lifestyle tips may be helpful:\n\n- **Maintain a Healthy Weight**: Regular exercise and a balanced diet can support testosterone production.\n- **Get Enough Sleep**: Good sleep is essential for hormone balance, including testosterone.\n- **Limit Alcohol Consumption**: Alcohol can interfere with hormone production, so reducing intake may support healthy levels.\n- **Reduce Stress**: Chronic stress can lower testosterone, so activities that promote relaxation, like hobbies or spending time outdoors, can be beneficial.\n- **Consider Medical Advice**: Your doctor may recommend specific treatments, so follow their guidance for any prescribed therapy.\n\n### Which Specialist Should You Consult?\n\nIf you have concerns about your testosterone levels or if your testosterone urine test results come back abnormal, various specialists can help:\n\n- **Endocrinologist**: Specializes in hormone-related disorders, including testosterone imbalances.\n- **Gynecologist**: For women experiencing issues with testosterone, such as those with PCOS.\n- **Andrologist**: Male reproductive health experts, especially for testosterone-related issues in men.\n- **Reproductologist**: For individuals or couples facing fertility challenges related to hormone levels.\n- **Oncologist**: In cases where a testosterone-related tumor is suspected.\n- **Therapist or General Practitioner**: For initial consultations and referrals to a specialist if needed.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Does testosterone show up in a urine drug test?\n\nNo, standard urine drug tests do not check for testosterone. They are typically designed to detect substances like narcotics, stimulants, and other controlled drugs. Testosterone testing requires a specific hormonal analysis.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# How long is testosterone detectable in urine?\n\nTestosterone is usually detectable in urine for about 24 hours. However, hormone levels can vary based on individual metabolism, and testing protocols may capture different averages over a 24-hour sample.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Can diet affect testosterone levels in urine?\n\nYes, diet can influence testosterone levels. Eating nutrient-rich foods that support hormone production, such as lean proteins, healthy fats, and foods high in vitamins D and zinc, may help maintain balanced testosterone levels.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# How long does it take to get results from a testosterone urine test?\n\nTestosterone urine test results usually take a few days, depending on the lab. Some specialized tests may take longer, especially if additional hormonal analyses are requested\n\nHave more questions?
