It’s used to spot blood disorders, track treatments, and ensure safe surgeries.\n\nKnowing your INR levels helps prevent serious risks like bleeding or clots.\n\nContents\n\n- [What Is INR?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/inr-blood-test#what-is-inr)\n- [When Is INR Testing Recommended?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/inr-blood-test#when-is-inr-testing-recommended)\n- [How Is INR Testing Conducted?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/inr-blood-test#how-is-inr-testing-conducted)\n- [What Are Normal INR Levels?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/inr-blood-test#what-are-normal-inr-levels)\n- [What Do Abnormal INR Levels Mean?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/inr-blood-test#what-do-abnormal-inr-levels-mean)\n\n## What Is INR?\n\nINR (International Normalized Ratio) is a test that checks how quickly your blood clots. It’s an important measure to find out if your blood is clotting too fast or too slow.\n\nDoctors use the INR test to diagnose and monitor health problems related to blood clotting. It’s especially helpful for people at risk of clotting disorders or excessive bleeding.\n\nThe INR value is based on a test called **[Prothrombin Time](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/prothrombin-time)** (PT), which measures how long it takes for your blood to form a clot.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Your Personal AI Doctor\n\nCustomize your AI Doctor to ask any health-related questions.

It’s useful for many reasons, such as:\n\n- **Checking clotting problems:** To see if your blood clots normally.\n- **Monitoring treatments:** If you are on blood-thinning medications or therapies, INR testing helps monitor whether the treatment is effective and safe.\n- **Before surgery:** To make sure there’s no risk of heavy bleeding during an operation.\n- **Diagnosing blood disorders:** It helps diagnose conditions such as hemophilia or thrombophilia, which can cause severe health issues if untreated.\n- **Testing liver function:** Since the liver produces many of the clotting factors, INR testing can indicate whether your liver is functioning properly.\n\n## How Is INR Testing Conducted?\n\nThe INR test is simple. A small sample of your blood is taken from a vein and tested in a lab. The result is calculated using this formula:\n\n**INR = (Your Prothrombin Time / Normal Prothrombin Time) × ISI (a sensitivity factor).**\n\nThe sensitivity factor (ISI) adjusts the INR test to ensure accurate and consistent results across different labs.\n\nINR is part of a [**coagulation panel**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/coagulation-panel) or **blood clotting test.**\n\n### Test Preparation\n\n- Tell your doctor about any medicines, supplements, or foods you consume that might affect your blood clotting.\n- Follow your doctor’s instructions about eating or drinking before the test.\n\n## What Are Normal INR Levels?\n\nFor individuals not on blood-thinning medications, a normal INR is between **0.8** and **1.2**.\n\nFor those on such medications, the target INR is usually higher, between **2.0** and **3.0**.\n\n**Note** _:_ _The units of measurement and the normal ranges can differ depending on the laboratory and the specific methods used_\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## What Do Abnormal INR Levels Mean?\n\n### High INR Levels\n\nA high INR means your blood is clotting slower than normal, which can increase the risk of bleeding. The main causes:\n\n- **Excessive anticoagulant medication:** Taking too much blood-thinning medication can overly prolong clotting time.\n- **Liver disease:** Conditions such as cirrhosis or hepatitis can impair the liver's ability to produce clotting factors and lead to a prolonged INR.\n- **Vitamin K deficiency:** Vitamin K is essential for blood clotting; a deficiency can result in an elevated INR.\n- **Interactions with other medications:** Some antibiotics or anti-inflammatory drugs can interfere with blood thinners and increase INR.\n- **Alcohol consumption:** Excessive alcohol intake can interfere with the metabolism of blood-thinning medications, leading to higher INR levels.\n- **Herbal supplements:** Certain herbs, like garlic, ginger, ginseng, and turmeric, can thin the blood or interact with blood thinners and raise INR levels.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\n- Talk to your doctor about the cause of your high INR.\n- Follow any changes to your treatment or diet.\n- Avoid activities that could lead to cuts or injuries.\n\n### Low INR Levels\n\nA low INR means your blood clots faster than normal, which can increase the risk of blood clots.\n\nSeveral factors can contribute to a low INR, including:\n\n- **Missed medication doses:** Skipping your blood thinner can make your blood clot faster.\n- **Eating too much Vitamin K:** Foods like spinach, kale, and broccoli can lower your INR by promoting clotting.\n- **Taking Vitamin K supplements:** These can cancel out the effect of blood thinners and reduce INR levels.\n- **Medication changes:** Starting or stopping certain medicines, like antibiotics or birth control, can affect INR.\n- **Diet changes:** Eating more soy or leafy greens can impact clotting and lower INR.\n- **Lifestyle changes:** Smoking or exercising more can affect how your body reacts to blood thinners.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\n- Discuss your results with your doctor.\n- Let your doctor know about all the foods, supplements, and medicines you take.\n- Work with your doctor to find out what’s causing the low INR and adjust your lifestyle if needed.\n\n### Which Specialist Should You Consult?\n\nIf your INR levels are not normal, you might need to see:\n\n- **Cardiologists:** For heart-related issues affecting blood clotting.\n- **Hematologists:** For blood disorders.\n- **Surgeons:** To ensure safe procedures.\n- **General Physicians:** For routine care and follow-up.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# How often should INR levels be checked if I’m on blood thinners?\n\nRegular monitoring depends on your health condition and treatment plan. Your doctor will recommend the frequency that’s right for you.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Can lifestyle changes affect INR results even if I’m not on medication?\n\nYes, changes like diet, exercise, or alcohol consumption can influence clotting and may impact INR levels.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What symptoms might indicate a problem with clotting that requires an INR test?\n\nSymptoms such as frequent bruising, prolonged bleeding, or unexplained blood clots could indicate a need for testing.\n\nHave more questions?
