Managing abnormal hematocrit levels is essential for overall health, as it impacts the body's ability to transport oxygen efficiently.\n\nContents\n\n- [What Is Hematocrit?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/hematocrit#what-is-hematocrit)\n- [When Is Hematocrit Testing Recommended?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/hematocrit#when-is-hematocrit-testing-recommended)\n- [How Is Hematocrit Testing Conducted?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/hematocrit#how-is-hematocrit-testing-conducted)\n- [What Are the Normal Hematocrit Levels?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/hematocrit#what-are-the-normal-hematocrit-levels)\n- [What Do Abnormal Levels Mean?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/hematocrit#what-do-abnormal-levels-mean)\n\n## What Is Hematocrit?\n\nHematocrit ( **Hct**) is a vital blood test parameter that measures the percentage of [red blood cells ( **RBCs**)](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/red-blood-cell-rbc) in your total blood volume. The hematocrit level is crucial because RBCs carry oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body.\n\nUnderstanding your hematocrit levels can help diagnose conditions such as [**anemia**](https://docus.ai/tags/anemia), **dehydration**, and **polycythemia**, among others.\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## When Is Hematocrit Testing Recommended?\n\nA hematocrit test is often prescribed when a doctor suspects conditions related to abnormal RBC counts. Symptoms prompting this test include:\n\n- **Pale Skin**\n- **Persistent Weakness**\n- **Loss of Appetite**\n- **Frequent** [**Headaches**](https://docus.ai/tags/headache)\n- [**Dizziness**](https://docus.ai/tags/dizziness) **or Fainting**\n- [**Chest Pain**](https://docus.ai/tags/chest-pain)\n- **Unexplained** [**Weight Loss**](https://docus.ai/tags/weight-loss)\n- **Hair Loss**\n\n## How Is Hematocrit Testing Conducted?\n\nThe hematocrit test is performed using a **blood sample**. A hematocrit test is usually part of a routine [**Complete Blood Count (CBC)**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/cbc-blood-test).\n\nTo prepare for a hematocrit test, ensure you follow any fasting instructions provided by your healthcare provider, and stay hydrated, as dehydration can affect the results.\n\n## What Are the Normal Hematocrit Levels?\n\nHematocrit levels vary by age, sex, and specific conditions such as pregnancy. Below are the standard ranges:\n\n**Children**\n\n_Males_:\n\n- Up to 2 years old: 30.8–37.8%\n- Up to 3 years old: 31.0–37.7%\n- Up to 7 years old: 34–42%\n- Up to 11 years old: 35–43%\n- Up to 15 years old: 38–47%\n- Up to 17 years old: 40–50%\n\n_Females_:\n\n- Up to 2 years old: 30.9–37.9%\n- Up to 3 years old: 31.2–37.8%\n- Up to 7 years old: 34–42%\n- Up to 17 years old: 35–43%\n\n**Adults**\n\n- **Males:** 38.3–48.6%\n- **Females:** 35.5–44.9%\n\n**Pregnant Women**\n\n- **First trimester:** 31-41%\n- **Second trimester:** 30-39%\n- **Third trimester:** 28-40%\n\n**Note** _: The units of measurement and the normal ranges can differ depending on the laboratory and the specific methods used._\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## What Do Abnormal Levels Mean?\n\n### Hematocrit High Levels\n\nA high hematocrit level means your blood has a higher concentration of red blood cells than normal. This condition can lead to thicker blood, which can increase the risk of blood clots, heart attack, or stroke. Common causes include:\n\n- **Smoking**: Nicotine can cause your body to produce more red blood cells.\n- **Living at High Altitudes**: Reduced oxygen levels at high altitudes stimulate the production of more RBCs.\n- **Dehydration**: Loss of fluids increases the concentration of RBCs in your blood.\n- **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)**: This lung condition reduces oxygen levels, leading to an increased RBC count.\n- **Polycythemia Vera**: A bone marrow disorder that causes excessive RBC production.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\n- **Quit Smoking:** Reducing or eliminating nicotine intake can help lower RBC production.\n- **Stay Hydrated:** Drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration, which can concentrate your blood.\n- **Monitor Oxygen Levels:** If you live at high altitudes or have a lung condition, consider using supplemental oxygen or relocating to a lower altitude.\n- **Consult Your Doctor:** Regular check-ups can help manage conditions like COPD and Polycythemia Vera, potentially reducing hematocrit levels.\n- **Blood Donation:** In some cases, donating blood may be recommended to reduce the number of red blood cells.\n\n### Hematocrit Low Levels\n\nLow hematocrit levels indicate a reduced number of red blood cells, which can lead to oxygen deficiency in tissues and organs. This condition can cause fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath. Causes of low hematocrit include:\n\n- **Anemia**: A condition marked by a deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin.\n- **Vitamin Deficiencies**: Lack of essential nutrients like Vitamin B-12 and folic acid can lead to reduced RBC production.\n- **Overhydration**: Excess fluid in the body can dilute the concentration of RBCs.\n- **Chronic Blood Loss**: Continuous loss of blood due to conditions like ulcers or heavy menstruation.\n- **Bone Marrow Disorders**: Conditions like leukemia and [lymphoma](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/lymphoma) can impair the bone marrow's ability to produce RBCs.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\n- **Improve Nutrition:** Ensure a diet rich in iron, Vitamin B-12, and folic acid to support healthy RBC production.\n- **Manage Blood Loss:** Seek medical advice to address conditions causing chronic blood loss, such as ulcers or heavy menstruation.\n- **Stay Hydrated, but Balanced:** Avoid excessive fluid intake that might dilute your blood.\n- **Consult a Specialist:** If you have a bone marrow disorder or anemia, work with a hematologist to develop a treatment plan.\n- **Consider Supplements:** In some cases, supplements like [iron](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/iron) or B-12 may be recommended by your doctor to boost red blood cell production.\n\n### Which Specialist Should You Consult?\n\nIf your hematocrit levels are abnormal, a consultation with a **hematologist**—a specialist in blood disorders—is often recommended. The hematologist may conduct further tests to determine the exact cause of the abnormal hematocrit levels and suggest appropriate treatments.\n\n#### Sources\n\nThis article was written by doctors from the Docus Medical Research team and leading experts in hematology.
