Get instant answers and tailored health insights.\n\n[Get Started](https://docus.ai/ai-doctor)\n\n## When Is Leukocyte Testing Recommended?\n\nTesting for leukocytes in urine is typically part of a routine [**urinalysis**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/urinalysis-test). It is often recommended when there are signs of a problem with the urinary system or kidneys. Here are common reasons for this test:\n\n- **Symptoms of a Urinary Tract Infection (** [**UTI**](https://docus.ai/tags/uti) **)**: This includes painful urination, needing to urinate often, or cloudy urine.\n- **Kidney Symptoms**: Such as pain in the lower back or swelling.\n- **After Surgery**: To check for possible infections following surgery on the urinary tract or kidneys.\n- **Routine Health Exams**: As part of standard check-ups to ensure overall health.\n- **Chronic Conditions**: For people with [diabetes](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/diabetes) or high blood pressure, which can impact kidney function.\n\n## How Is Leukocyte Testing Conducted?\n\nLeukocyte testing is generally done as part of a urinalysis, which checks for various substances in the urine, including white blood cells.\n\nMethods of leukocyte testing **:**\n\n1. **Dipstick Test**: A chemically treated strip is dipped into a urine sample. If leukocytes are present, the strip changes color.\n2. **Microscopic Examination**: The urine sample is analyzed under a microscope to count the number of leukocytes.\n3. **Leukocyte Esterase Test**: The leukocyte esterase test is part of the dipstick test that looks for an enzyme (specific protein) called leukocyte esterase, which is released by white blood cells. If the test shows a positive result, it means white blood cells are present in the urine, which could point to an infection or inflammation.\n\n### Preparations for the Test\n\n- **Clean-Catch Method**: To avoid contamination, it is often recommended to clean the genital area before collecting a urine sample.\n- **Avoid Certain Substances**: Refrain from using substances such as vaginal creams or douches before the test, as they may affect the results.\n\n## What Are the Normal Leukocyte Levels?\n\nThe normal range for leukocytes in urine can vary based on the individual's sex and age.\n\nStandard values:\n\n- **Males**: 0-11 units/mcL\n- **Females**: 0-27 units/mcL\n\n**Note**: _The units of measurement and normal ranges may differ depending on the laboratory and the specific methods used._\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## What Do High Levels Mean?\n\nHigh levels of WBC in urine often point to an infection or inflammation within the urinary system.\n\nPossible causes:\n\n- **Holding in Urine**: This may lead to bacterial growth, causing infection.\n- **Kidney Infection**: An advanced form of UTI that affects the kidneys.\n- **Bladder Infection (Cystitis)**: Inflammation and infection of the bladder.\n- **Kidney Stones**: Stones can block urine flow, leading to infection and inflammation.\n- **Urinary Tract Blockage**: Caused by an obstruction that prevents normal urine flow.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n- **Work with Your Doctor**: Schedule an appointment to determine the underlying cause. Your doctor can recommend further tests or treatments based on your specific condition to help manage or resolve the issue effectively.\n- **Stay Hydrated**: Drinking plenty of water helps flush out bacteria.\n- **Incorporate Cranberries**: These may support urinary health by preventing bacteria from sticking to the bladder walls.\n- **Practice Good Hygiene**: Simple habits like wiping from front to back and regularly washing the genital area can make a significant difference. This reduces the risk of infections.\n\n### Which Specialist Should You Consult?\n\nIf your urinalysis shows high or low levels of leukocytes, consulting a **nephrologist** is often recommended. Nephrologists specialize in kidney and urinary health and can guide you through appropriate diagnostic tests and treatment plans.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Can stress cause leukocytes in urine?\n\nWhile stress itself is not a direct cause of leukocytes in urine, it can weaken the immune system and potentially contribute to health conditions that may lead to increased leukocytes.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# How to get rid of leukocytes in urine naturally?\n\nStaying well-hydrated, practicing good hygiene, and incorporating foods like cranberries into your diet can help maintain urinary health and reduce leukocytes in urine naturally.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Why are there leukocytes in urine but no infection?\n\nLeukocytes in urine without an infection could be due to other causes such as inflammation, kidney stones, or holding urine for too long. It’s important to consult a doctor for further evaluation.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Why are there leukocytes in urine during pregnancy?\n\nLeukocytes in urine during pregnancy can be common due to an increased risk of urinary tract infections. It is important to discuss any findings with a healthcare provider for proper management.\n\nHave more questions?
