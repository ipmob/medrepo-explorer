It’s important for spotting health issues like **diabetes**, **obesity**, and **heart disease**.\n\nContents\n\n- [What Is Adiponectin?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/adiponectin#what-is-adiponectin)\n- [When Is Adiponectin Testing Recommended?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/adiponectin#when-is-adiponectin-testing-recommended)\n- [How Is Adiponectin Testing Conducted?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/adiponectin#how-is-adiponectin-testing-conducted)\n- [What Are the Normal Adiponectin Levels?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/adiponectin#what-are-the-normal-adiponectin-levels)\n- [What Do Low Levels Mean?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/adiponectin#what-do-low-levels-mean)\n\n## What Is Adiponectin?\n\n**Adiponectin** is a key hormone that keeps your metabolism in check. Produced by fat cells, it regulates how your body breaks down fats and uses [glucose](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/glucose). When your adiponectin levels are balanced, your body runs smoothly. But when they’re off, it can signal potential health issues.\n\nLowadiponectin levels are more common. High levels are less frequent and usually occur in people with **lower body weight** or a **stable metabolism**. Unusually high levels require further investigation to rule out potential underlying conditions.\n\nDoctors use adiponectin as a **biomarker** to assess risks for diseases like [**diabetes**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/diabetes), **obesity**, and **heart conditions**. It's like a warning light, helping you take action before problems worsen.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Your Personal AI Doctor\n\nCustomize your AI Doctor to ask any health-related questions. Get instant answers and tailored health insights.\n\n[Get Started](https://docus.ai/ai-doctor)\n\n## When Is Adiponectin Testing Recommended?\n\nDoctors recommend adiponectin testing to evaluate metabolic health and monitor the risk of certain conditions. It’s especially helpful in identifying issues before they worsen.\n\nYour doctor may recommend this test if:\n\n- You’re struggling with obesity.\n- You have a family history of heart disease.\n- You’re experiencing symptoms like excessive thirst or frequent urination.\n- You have a history of metabolic syndrome or diabetes.\n- You’ve recently lost weight rapidly without explanation.\n\n## How Is Adiponectin Testing Conducted?\n\nTesting adiponectin levels is simple. It’s done through a [**blood test**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview) **.** A small sample is drawn, usually from a vein in your arm, and analyzed in a lab.\n\nThe most common technique is **ELISA** (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay). It provides precise results.\n\n**Special Preparations**\n\n- You might need to fast for 8–12 hours before the test.\n- Avoid intense exercise the day before, as it can affect results.\n- Let your doctor know if you’re taking any supplements or medications.\n\n## What Are the Normal Adiponectin Levels?\n\nAdiponectin levels differ by gender:\n\n- **Men**: 4–28 mcg/ml\n- **Women**: 5–37 mcg/ml\n\n**Note:** _Normal ranges can vary depending on the lab and testing methods used. Always consult your doctor to interpret your results._\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## What Do Low Levels Mean?\n\nLow adiponectin is common and can signal underlying issues. It’s often linked to:\n\n- **Obesity**: Excess fat reduces adiponectin production.\n- **Type 2 diabetes**: Low levels can worsen [insulin](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/insulin) resistance.\n- **Metabolic syndrome**: Indicates poor glucose and fat regulation.\n- **Cardiovascular risks**: A drop in adiponectin raises the risk of heart disease.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n- **Incorporate physical activity**: Even light exercise can help balance hormones.\n- Focus on **nutrient-rich foods** to support fat metabolism.\n- Work closely with your doctor to address underlying health conditions.\n\n### Which Specialist Should You Consult?\n\nIf your test shows abnormal adiponectin levels, don’t panic. A **general practitioner** or **endocrinologist** can guide you. They’ll help pinpoint the cause and create a personalized treatment plan. Early action can make a huge difference in protecting your health.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Can diet affect adiponectin levels?\n\nYes, eating a balanced diet rich in healthy fats, lean proteins, and fiber can help improve adiponectin levels. Avoiding processed foods and excess sugar is also beneficial.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Are adiponectin levels hereditary?\n\nGenetics can influence adiponectin levels. A family history of metabolic conditions might mean you're more likely to have lower levels.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Can stress impact adiponectin levels?\n\nChronic stress can disrupt hormone balance, potentially lowering adiponectin levels over time. Managing stress through relaxation techniques can help.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Is adiponectin linked to exercise?\n\nYes, regular physical activity boosts adiponectin levels, especially moderate-intensity aerobic exercises like walking, jogging, or cycling.\n\nHave more questions?
