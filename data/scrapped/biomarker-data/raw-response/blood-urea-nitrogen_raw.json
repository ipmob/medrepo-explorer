Urea is a waste product filtered by the kidneys.\n\nBUN shows how well your kidneys and liver are working. It can help find problems like kidney disease, dehydration, or liver issues.\n\nKnowing your BUN levels is important for tracking health and discovering problems early.\n\nContents\n\n- [What Is Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/blood-urea-nitrogen#what-is-blood-urea-nitrogen-bun)\n- [When Is Blood Urea Nitrogen Testing Recommended?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/blood-urea-nitrogen#when-is-blood-urea-nitrogen-testing-recommended)\n- [How Is Blood Urea Nitrogen Testing Conducted?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/blood-urea-nitrogen#how-is-blood-urea-nitrogen-testing-conducted)\n- [What Are the Normal Blood Urea Nitrogen Levels?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/blood-urea-nitrogen#what-are-the-normal-blood-urea-nitrogen-levels)\n- [What Do Abnormal Blood Urea Nitrogen Levels Mean?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/blood-urea-nitrogen#what-do-abnormal-blood-urea-nitrogen-levels-mean)\n\n## What Is Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)?\n\nBlood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) is a measurement of **the nitrogen content in urea**, a waste product formed when the body breaks down proteins.\n\nThe liver processes protein and produces urea, which is then filtered by the kidneys and expelled through urine.\n\nThis biomarker plays a critical role in evaluating kidney function and overall metabolic health. Doctors often use BUN levels to diagnose conditions like **kidney disease**, **liver dysfunction**, and **dehydration**.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Your Personal AI Doctor\n\nCustomize your AI Doctor to ask any health-related questions. Get instant answers and tailored health insights.\n\n[Get Started](https://docus.ai/ai-doctor)\n\n## When Is Blood Urea Nitrogen Testing Recommended?\n\nBUN testing is prescribed when there are concerns about kidney or liver health.\n\nIt can also monitor the effects of specific treatments or conditions. Below are common scenarios where this test is recommended:\n\n- **Kidney Issues:** Symptoms of kidney dysfunction, such as swelling, fatigue, or changes in urination.\n- **Chronic Illness Monitoring:** Conditions like [diabetes](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/diabetes), high blood pressure, or heart disease that may impact kidney health.\n- **Dehydration Symptoms:** Persistent thirst, dizziness, or confusion may warrant a test.\n- **Before Starting Medications:** Particularly if the drugs may affect kidney function.\n- **Dialysis Patients:** To assess kidney function and adjust treatments.\n- **Surgical Planning:** Especially in individuals with a history of kidney or liver issues.\n\n## How Is Blood Urea Nitrogen Testing Conducted?\n\nBUN is measured through a simple [blood test](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview). A healthcare provider draws a sample from a vein and sends it to a laboratory for analysis.\n\nThis measurement is often included in [metabolic panels](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/metabolic-panel) \\- Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP) and Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP).\n\nMany diagnostic panels also evaluate the [BUN/Creatinine Ratio](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/bun-creatinine-ratio). This ratio provides additional context for interpreting kidney health by comparing nitrogen waste (BUN) to [creatinine](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/creatinine-key-insights), another waste product filtered by the kidneys.\n\n**Preparation for the Test:**\n\n- **Fasting:** Avoid food or drinks (except water) for 8-12 hours before the test if instructed.\n- **Medication:** Inform your doctor about any medications or supplements, as some may affect results.\n- **Hydration:** Ensure adequate water intake unless instructed otherwise.\n\n## What Are the Normal Blood Urea Nitrogen Levels?\n\nNormal BUN levels depend on age, gender, and overall health. Typical ranges are:\n\n- **Children (Under 17 Years):** 7-20 mg/dL.\n- **Adults (18 and Older):**\n  - Males: 8-24 mg/dL.\n  - Females: 6-21 mg/dL.\n\n**Note:** _The units of measurement and normal ranges may vary depending on the laboratory and testing methods._\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## What Do Abnormal Blood Urea Nitrogen Levels Mean?\n\n### Blood Urea Nitrogen High Levels\n\nElevated BUN levels indicate that the kidneys may not be functioning properly or that other underlying issues exist. Common causes include:\n\n- **Kidney Disorders:** Chronic conditions like glomerulonephritis or acute kidney injuries.\n- **Dehydration:** Reduced fluid levels increase nitrogen concentration in the blood.\n- **High Protein Diet:** Consuming excess protein can elevate BUN levels.\n- **Urinary Tract Obstruction:** Blockages, such as kidney stones, prevent proper filtration.\n- **Heart Issues:** Congestive heart failure or reduced blood flow to the kidneys.\n- **Severe Infections:** Conditions that strain the kidneys, such as sepsis.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\nTo manage elevated BUN levels, consider the following steps:\n\n- Consult your doctor to determine the root cause.\n- Increase water intake to stay adequately hydrated.\n- Adopt a balanced diet, reducing excessive protein consumption.\n- Follow medical advice for managing underlying conditions like kidney or heart disease.\n\n### Blood Urea Nitrogen Low Levels\n\nLow BUN levels often indicate liver dysfunction or inadequate protein intake. Common causes include:\n\n- **Liver Disorders:** Conditions like [hepatitis](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/hepatitis) or cirrhosis that impair urea production.\n- **Malnutrition:** Insufficient dietary protein affects urea formation.\n- **Overhydration:** Excess water dilutes nitrogen levels in the blood.\n- **Pregnancy:** Hormonal changes during the third trimester can alter BUN levels.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\nTo address low BUN levels, you can:\n\n- Work with a doctor to identify the cause of low levels.\n- Include adequate protein in your diet, such as lean meats, dairy, or plant-based options.\n- Avoid excessive alcohol consumption.\n- Ensure proper hydration without overhydrating.\n\n### Which Specialist Should You Consult?\n\nIf BUN levels are abnormal, consulting the right specialist ensures proper diagnosis and treatment. Depending on the underlying issue, you may need to see:\n\n- **General Practitioner:** For initial evaluation and referrals.\n- **Nephrologist:** For kidney-related concerns or abnormalities.\n- **Hepatologist:** If liver dysfunction is suspected.\n- **Nutritionist:** To address dietary issues affecting protein intake.\n- **Cardiologist:** For heart-related conditions affecting BUN levels.\n\n#### Sources\n\nThis article was written by doctors from the Docus Medical Research team and reviewed by leading nephrology experts.
