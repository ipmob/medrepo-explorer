In the body, oxalate binds with minerals, especially calcium, to form crystals. These oxalate [crystals](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/crystals-in-urine) can sometimes build up in the kidneys, potentially leading to kidney stones or other health issues.\n\nHealthcare professionals use urinary oxalate levels as a biomarker to assess kidney function and diagnose specific metabolic or renal conditions.\n\nTracking oxalate in urine can help manage kidney health, detect dietary issues, and support overall metabolic function.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Your Personal AI Doctor\n\nCustomize your AI Doctor to ask any health-related questions.

In this test, all urine excreted over a 24-hour period is collected and analyzed in a laboratory. This method provides a more accurate picture of daily oxalate excretion levels. Sometimes, a random urine sample may be taken, though the 24-hour collection is more precise.\n\n**Preparation for Oxalate Testing**\n\nTo prepare for an oxalate urine test, consider the following:\n\n- **Avoid high-oxalate foods**: Foods like spinach, beets, rhubarb, nuts, and chocolate can elevate oxalate levels, so it’s recommended to avoid them for at least 24 hours before testing (unless your doctor advises otherwise).\n- **Limit vitamin C intake**: High doses of vitamin C can increase oxalate in urine, so it’s best to reduce intake before testing.\n- **Stay hydrated**: Drinking adequate water helps produce an accurate urine sample but avoid excessive intake, as it may dilute the results.\n- **Follow lab instructions**: Follow any specific guidelines provided by the lab or healthcare provider.\n\n## What Are the Normal Oxalate Levels?\n\nThe typical range for urinary oxalate in adults is **0.08-0.49 mmol/L** over a 24-hour period.\n\n**Note**: _The units of measurement and normal ranges can differ depending on the laboratory and the specific methods used._\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## What Do Abnormal Levels Mean?\n\nAbnormal oxalate levels, whether high or low, may indicate underlying health issues or imbalances that require attention.\n\n### Oxalate High Levels\n\nHigh levels of oxalate in the urine, known as hyperoxaluria, can have several causes, often indicating metabolic or dietary issues:\n\n- **Kidney Stones**: Excessive oxalate can bind with calcium, forming crystals that develop into kidney stones.\n- **Diet High in Oxalate-Rich Foods**: Regular consumption of high-oxalate foods, such as spinach, nuts, and beets, can increase oxalate levels.\n- **Vitamin C Overconsumption**: High doses of [vitamin C](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/vitamin-c) convert to oxalate, raising levels in the urine.\n- **Primary Hyperoxaluria**: A rare genetic disorder where the liver produces excess oxalate.\n- **Malabsorption Conditions**: Conditions like Crohn’s disease or celiac disease can increase oxalate absorption.\n- **Renal Tubular Acidosis**: A kidney disorder that leads to a build-up of oxalate due to metabolic imbalance.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\n- **Increase Water Intake**: Drinking more water helps flush oxalate from the kidneys and reduces the risk of stone formation.\n- **Limit High-Oxalate Foods**: Reduce foods like spinach, rhubarb, nuts, and chocolate that are high in oxalates.\n- **Calcium Intake with Meals**: Eating calcium-rich foods with meals can help bind oxalate in the gut, preventing its absorption.\n- **Consult a Dietitian**: Work with a dietitian to create a low-oxalate, kidney-friendly meal plan.\n- **Moderate Vitamin C Supplementation**: Avoid excessive vitamin C, as it can increase oxalate production.\n\n### Oxalate Low Levels\n\nLow levels of oxalate in urine are generally uncommon and usually not concerning. However, certain conditions or dietary factors can lead to low oxalate levels.\n\n- **Low-Oxalate Diet**: A diet very low in oxalate-rich foods may result in reduced oxalate levels.\n- **Chronic Diarrhea**: Frequent diarrhea can reduce oxalate levels due to increased excretion.\n- **Vitamin B6 Deficiency**: This vitamin helps regulate oxalate metabolism, and low levels can affect oxalate levels in the urine.\n- **Malnutrition**: Poor nutritional status or restricted diets may contribute to low oxalate levels.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\n- **Balanced Diet**: Aim for a well-rounded diet that includes a variety of nutrients to maintain normal metabolic function.\n- **Avoid Extreme Dietary Restrictions**: Avoid overly restrictive diets unless prescribed, as they can impact oxalate and nutrient levels.\n- **Consult a Healthcare Provider**: If low levels are accompanied by symptoms, seek guidance for further evaluation.\n- **Monitor for Deficiencies**: Ensure adequate intake of vitamins, particularly B6, which plays a role in oxalate metabolism.\n\n### Which Specialist Should You Consult?\n\nFor concerns about oxalate levels in urine, consult one of the following specialists:\n\n- **Urologist**: Specializes in urinary tract health and can assess oxalate levels related to kidney stones or urinary issues.\n- **Nephrologist**: A kidney specialist who can diagnose and manage oxalate-related kidney conditions and metabolic disorders.\n- **General Practitioner**: Can conduct initial testing and refer to specialists if high or low oxalate levels are detected.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# How to flush oxalates from body?\n\nTo flush oxalates from the body, increase your water intake to help dilute and remove oxalates through urine. Consuming calcium-rich foods with meals can also bind oxalates in the digestive tract, reducing absorption. Additionally, limit high-oxalate foods like spinach, nuts, and beets. Consult with a healthcare provider for personalized guidance, especially if you have kidney concerns.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Can oxalate levels affect bone health?\n\nHigh oxalate levels may impact calcium availability, potentially affecting bone density if left unmanaged over time.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# How does gut health influence oxalate levels in urine?\n\nGut health affects oxalate absorption; conditions like IBS or poor gut microbiome health can increase urinary oxalate levels.\n\nHave more questions?
