It plays a significant role in diagnosing and monitoring conditions such as autoimmune diseases, infections, and metabolic disorders.\n\nContents\n\n- [What Is Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/erythrocyte-sedimentation-rate#what-is-erythrocyte-sedimentation-rate-esr)\n- [When Is ESR Testing Recommended?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/erythrocyte-sedimentation-rate#when-is-esr-testing-recommended)\n- [How Is ESR Testing Conducted?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/erythrocyte-sedimentation-rate#how-is-esr-testing-conducted)\n- [What Are the Normal ESR Levels?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/erythrocyte-sedimentation-rate#what-are-the-normal-esr-levels)\n- [What Do High ESR Levels Mean?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/erythrocyte-sedimentation-rate#what-do-high-esr-levels-mean)\n\n## What Is Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)?\n\nThe erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) measures **how quickly [red blood cells](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/red-blood-cell-rbc) (RBCs) settle at the bottom of a test tube**. It is a simple blood test used to detect inflammation in the body.\n\nRed blood cells **normally settle slowly**. However, inflammation causes proteins in the blood to make these cells clump together, making them sink faster. ESR results indicate the presence of inflammation, though they cannot pinpoint the exact cause.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Your Personal AI Doctor\n\nCustomize your AI Doctor to ask any health-related questions. Get instant answers and tailored health insights.\n\n[Get Started](https://docus.ai/ai-doctor)\n\n## When Is ESR Testing Recommended?\n\nDoctors commonly prescribe ESR testing to investigate suspected inflammation when the exact cause is unclear.\n\nThis biomarker is widely used to diagnose and monitor conditions such as **[autoimmune diseases](https://docus.ai/tags/autoimmune-diseases)**, **infections**, and **some blood disorders**. This test is also used to monitor conditions like **arthritis**, **inflammatory bowel diseases**, and **systemic infections**.\n\nYou might need an ESR test if you experience:\n\n- **Unexplained fever** that persists over time.\n- **Joint or muscle pain** without a clear cause.\n- **Fatigue** that does not improve with rest.\n- **Headaches** that occur frequently or without an obvious trigger.\n- **Unexplained weight loss**.\n- **Symptoms of autoimmune diseases**, such as skin rashes or swelling.\n\n## How Is ESR Testing Conducted?\n\nESR testing involves a simple blood draw performed by a healthcare professional.\n\nESR is typically included in broader diagnostic panels such as:\n\n- [**Complete Blood Count (CBC)**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/cbc-blood-test)\n- [**Comprehensive Metabolic Panel**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/metabolic-panel) **(CMP)**\n- **Arthritis or Rheumatology Panels**\n\nNo specific preparation is needed for an ESR test. If combined with other tests, fasting may be required. Your doctor will provide clear instructions beforehand.\n\n## What Are the Normal ESR Levels?\n\nNormal ESR levels vary based on factors such as age, sex, and the specific method used. General reference ranges are:\n\nFor adults using the Westergren method:\n\n- **Men under 50 years old**: ESR is less than 15 mm/hr.\n- **Men over 50 years old**: ESR is less than 20 mm/hr.\n- **Women under 50 years old**: ESR is less than 20 mm/hr.\n- **Women over 50 years old**: ESR is less than 30 mm/hr.\n\nFor children using the Westergren method:\n\n- **Newborns**: ESR ranges from 0 to 2 mm/hr.\n- **Children from newborn to puberty**: ESR ranges from 3 to 13 mm/hr.\n\nESR is measured in millimeters per hour \\[mm/hr\\].\n\n**Note**: _Units of measurement and normal ranges may differ between laboratories and methods used. Always consult your healthcare provider for accurate interpretation_\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## What Do High ESR Levels Mean?\n\nElevated ESR levels mean red blood cells settle faster than normal, often due to increased inflammatory proteins in the blood. Common causes include:\n\n- **Autoimmune diseases**: Conditions like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis increase inflammation.\n- **Infections**: Systemic or localized infections can elevate ESR.\n- **Cancer**: Some cancers, such as [lymphoma](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/lymphoma) or multiple myeloma, can raise ESR.\n- **Kidney or** [**thyroid diseases**](https://docus.ai/tags/thyroid-issues): Chronic illnesses can impact blood composition.\n- **Tissue damage**: Injuries or trauma lead to inflammation and higher ESR.\n\nESR values are not only influenced by medical conditions but also by **modifiable behaviors** (e.g., smoking, low physical activity) and **metabolic health** (e.g., obesity, metabolic syndrome).\n\n### Recommendations\n\n- Follow up with your doctor to identify the underlying cause.\n- Manage inflammation with lifestyle changes, such as:\n  - Eating an anti-inflammatory diet (rich in fruits, vegetables, and omega-3s).\n  - Staying physically active to improve circulation.\n  - Reducing stress through mindfulness or relaxation techniques.\n\n### Which Specialist Should You Consult?\n\nThe type of specialist you consult depends on your symptoms and underlying conditions:\n\n- **Rheumatologist**: For autoimmune diseases like arthritis or lupus.\n- **Infectious Disease Specialist**: For infections causing abnormal ESR levels.\n- **Hematologist**: For blood disorders such as anemia or polycythemia.\n- **General Practitioner**: For initial evaluation and referrals as needed.\n\nAlways discuss your ESR results with a healthcare provider to understand their significance and next steps.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Why is ESR higher in females?\n\nESR is often higher in females due to hormonal changes, body composition differences, and factors like menstruation or pregnancy.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What is the ESR level in cancer patients?\n\nIn cancer patients, ESR levels can vary. A very high ESR (above 100 mm/hr) may suggest advanced cancer or metastasis.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# What color tube is used for the ESR test?\n\nA lavender-top tube with EDTA is used for ESR testing to prevent blood clotting and ensure accurate results.\n\nHave more questions?
