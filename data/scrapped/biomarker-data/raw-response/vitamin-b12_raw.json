Deficiency, often caused by poor absorption or certain diets, can lead to serious health issues if untreated.\n\nContents\n\n- [What Is Vitamin B12?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/vitamin-b12#what-is-vitamin-b12)\n- [When Is Vitamin B12 Testing Recommended?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/vitamin-b12#when-is-vitamin-b12-testing-recommended)\n- [How Is Vitamin B12 Testing Conducted?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/vitamin-b12#how-is-vitamin-b12-testing-conducted)\n- [What Are the Normal Vitamin B12 Levels?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/vitamin-b12#what-are-the-normal-vitamin-b12-levels)\n- [What Do Abnormal Vitamin B12 Levels Mean?](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/vitamin-b12#what-do-abnormal-vitamin-b12-levels-mean)\n\n## What Is Vitamin B12?\n\n**Vitamin B12**, also known as **cobalamin**, is a water-soluble vitamin that plays a critical role in the body’s functioning. It is essential for:\n\n- **Red blood cell formation**: B12 helps create red blood cells that carry oxygen throughout the body.\n- **Nervous system support**: It aids in the formation of the protective covering around nerves, known as myelin, ensuring proper nerve function.\n- **DNA synthesis**: It helps produce DNA, the genetic material needed for cell growth and repair.\n\nVitamin B12 levels are often checked to diagnose conditions related to blood health, neurological function, and digestion.\n\nTesting for Vitamin B12 can help doctors detect deficiencies or high levels, which may point to underlying health issues like anemia, malabsorption disorders, or certain liver and blood diseases.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Your Personal AI Doctor\n\nCustomize your AI Doctor to ask any health-related questions. Get instant answers and tailored health insights.\n\n[Get Started](https://docus.ai/ai-doctor)\n\n## When Is Vitamin B12 Testing Recommended?\n\nA doctor may recommend testing your Vitamin B12 levels to monitor your health or if you have symptoms related to B12 deficiency or excess. Testing is prescribed in the following cases:\n\n- **Signs of Vitamin B12 deficiency**: Symptoms such as weakness, fatigue, memory loss, or tingling in the hands and feet.\n- **Monitoring chronic conditions**: For people with conditions like Crohn’s disease, celiac disease, or pernicious anemia, which can affect B12 absorption.\n- **After gastric surgery**: To check if your body is absorbing Vitamin B12 properly after weight loss surgery or other stomach procedures.\n- **Vegan or vegetarian diets**: As B12 is mostly found in animal products, people on plant-based diets may need regular testing to ensure they aren’t deficient.\n- **Long-term medication use**: Some medications may interfere with B12 absorption, leading to low levels over time.\n\n## How Is Vitamin B12 Testing Conducted?\n\nVitamin B12 is most commonly measured through a [**blood test**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview). During this test, a healthcare professional draws blood from a vein in your arm. The sample is then analyzed in a lab to determine the amount of Vitamin B12 present in your blood.\n\nThere are also more specialized tests that may include B12 levels:\n\n- [**Complete Blood Count (CBC)**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/cbc-blood-test): This test measures different parts of your blood, including red blood cell size, which can indicate if you have a B12 deficiency.\n- **Methylmalonic Acid (MMA) Test**: High levels of MMA in your blood or urine can suggest low Vitamin B12.\n- **Intrinsic Factor Antibody Test**: This test helps determine if your body produces antibodies that attack intrinsic factor, a protein needed for B12 absorption.\n\n**Preparations**\n\n- Avoid eating for 6-8 hours before the test, if recommended by your doctor.\n- Inform your healthcare provider about any supplements or medications you are taking, as they may affect the test results.\n- Do not stop any medications unless your doctor advises it.\n\n## What Are the Normal Vitamin B12 Levels?\n\nFor adults, the normal range of Vitamin B12 in the blood is generally between:\n\n- **160 to 950 pg/mL** (picograms per milliliter).\n\n**Note:** _The units of measurement and the normal ranges can differ depending on the laboratory and the specific methods used._\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## What Do Abnormal Vitamin B12 Levels Mean?\n\nAbnormal levels of Vitamin B12 in your blood can indicate several health issues, depending on whether the levels are too high or too low.\n\n### High Levels\n\nHigh Vitamin B12 levels are less common but can signal underlying health conditions. Some of the causes include:\n\n- **Liver disease**: When the liver is damaged, it may release excess Vitamin B12 into the blood.\n- **Polycythemia vera**: A rare blood disorder where the body produces too many red blood cells, leading to elevated B12 levels.\n- **Leukemia**: Certain types of blood cancers can increase the amount of Vitamin B12 in the blood.\n- **Kidney disease**: Impaired kidney function may prevent B12 from being properly filtered out of the blood.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\n- **Consult with your doctor** to investigate the cause of elevated levels, as high B12 is usually a sign of another underlying condition.\n- **Regular monitoring** of blood tests to track B12 levels and adjust treatment as needed.\n- **Lifestyle adjustments** based on your doctor’s advice, which may include changes in diet or treatment for the underlying condition.\n\n### Low Levels\n\n[Low levels of Vitamin B12](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/vitamin-b12-deficiency-recovery-duration) can be more common and often lead to symptoms like fatigue, nerve issues, and anemia. Causes of low Vitamin B12 include:\n\n- **Dietary deficiency**: People who follow vegan or vegetarian diets are more at risk since B12 is primarily found in animal products.\n- **Pernicious anemia**: A condition where the body cannot absorb B12 due to a lack of intrinsic factor.\n- **Gastric surgery**: After certain surgeries, such as a gastric bypass, the body may struggle to absorb B12 properly.\n- **Malabsorption disorders**: Conditions like Crohn’s disease or celiac disease interfere with nutrient absorption, leading to low B12.\n- **Aging**: As people age, their bodies may naturally become less efficient at absorbing Vitamin B12.\n\n#### Recommendations\n\n- **Increase your intake of B12-rich foods**: Include more meat, fish, eggs, and dairy in your diet. If you're vegan or vegetarian, choose fortified foods like plant-based milks and cereals.\n- **Reduce alcohol consumption**: Excessive alcohol can interfere with B12 absorption.\n- **Quit smoking**: Smoking may decrease the effectiveness of B12 absorption.\n- **Follow up with regular testing**: If you have a medical condition that affects absorption, work with your doctor to regularly monitor your B12 levels.\n- **Consider B12 supplements**: If you have trouble absorbing B12 from food, your doctor may recommend oral supplements or injections.\n\n### Which Specialist Should You Consult?\n\nIf you have abnormal Vitamin B12 levels or are experiencing symptoms of deficiency or excess, it's important to consult the right healthcare specialist. Here’s who you may need to see:\n\n- **General practitioner**: For an initial diagnosis and overall management of your condition.\n- **Gastroenterologist**: If you have absorption issues related to your digestive system, such as Crohn’s disease or after gastric surgery.\n- **Hematologist**: For blood-related conditions like anemia or polycythemia.\n- **Neurologist**: If you experience nerve-related symptoms such as tingling or numbness, which may be linked to B12 deficiency.\n- **Nutritionist**: To help you adjust your diet and ensure you’re getting enough Vitamin B12, especially if you follow a plant-based diet.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# Can Vitamin B12 deficiency be a sign of cancer?\n\nIn some cases, a [Vitamin B12 deficiency can be linked to certain cancers](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/vitamin-b12-deficiency-sign-of-cancer), especially if the deficiency is caused by conditions that affect nutrient absorption, such as stomach or intestinal cancers. However, it is more commonly associated with other conditions like pernicious anemia or malabsorption disorders. If you're concerned about Vitamin B12 deficiency, it's important to consult a healthcare provider for a thorough diagnosis.\n\nHave more questions?
