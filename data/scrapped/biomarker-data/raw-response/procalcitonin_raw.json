Its levels in the blood are usually very low.\n\nWhen the body detects a bacterial infection, procalcitonin levels rise sharply. It is then produced in the liver and kidneys.\n\nProcalcitonin is a key biomarker for identifying infections. It helps doctors **diagnose the severity of bacterial infections** and **separate them from viral ones**. It is also useful for monitoring sepsis and guiding treatment decisions.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Your Personal AI Doctor\n\nCustomize your AI Doctor to ask any health-related questions.

Doctors may prescribe this test to confirm the presence and severity of the condition.\n\n- **Sepsis suspicion:** To detect life-threatening infections that spread throughout the body.\n- **Post-surgical complications:** To check for infections following major surgeries.\n- **Severe infections:** To evaluate critical infections in the lungs, abdomen, or other areas.\n- **Monitoring treatment progress:** To assess the effectiveness of antibiotics or other infection control strategies.\n- **Differentiating between infections:** To distinguish bacterial infections from viral ones, which may present similar symptoms.\n\n## How Is Procalcitonin Testing Conducted?\n\nProcalcitonin levels are measured through a [blood test](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview), making the process straightforward and widely accessible. A small sample of blood is drawn from a vein, and advanced techniques are used to analyze it.\n\n- **Test types:** The test is often included in panels like sepsis diagnostic panels or [inflammation markers](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-tests-for-inflammation).\n- **Preparation for the test:**\n  - Avoid eating for at least 8 hours before the test.\n  - In some urgent cases, testing may be performed without preparation.\n  - Inform the doctor about any ongoing treatments or health conditions.\n- **Testing methods:** An immunochemiluminescent assay is typically used, offering precise and reliable results.\n\n## What Are the Normal Procalcitonin Levels?\n\nNormal procalcitonin levels in healthy adults range from **0.0 to 0.1 ng/ml**.\n\n**Note:** _The units of measurement and the normal ranges can differ depending on the laboratory and the specific methods used. Always consult the report alongside medical advice for proper interpretation._\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## What Do High Levels Mean?\n\nHigh procalcitonin levels indicate the presence of severe infections or related conditions. This biomarker helps in diagnosing the following:\n\n- **Sepsis:** A severe, life-threatening bacterial infection that spreads through the bloodstream.\n- **Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS):** A condition caused by infection, trauma, or burns that triggers widespread inflammation.\n- **Organ failure:** High levels may indicate multiple organ dysfunction due to severe infections or injury.\n- **Surgical complications:** Severe infections post-surgery can elevate procalcitonin levels.\n- **Trauma:** Serious physical injuries may result in heightened levels.\n- **Transplant rejection:** Elevated procalcitonin levels can signal complications following organ transplants.\n\n### Recommendations\n\nManaging high procalcitonin levels involves addressing the underlying condition. Here are some general recommendations:\n\n- **Seek immediate medical attention:** Prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial.\n- **Follow prescribed treatments:** Adhere to all medical instructions provided by your doctor.\n- **Monitor progress:** Regular follow-ups and tests ensure the condition is under control.\n- **Adopt a healthy lifestyle:** Boost your immune system with proper nutrition and rest.\n\n### Which Specialist Should You Consult?\n\nDepending on the suspected cause, you may need to consult:\n\n- **Infectious disease specialists:** For bacterial infections or sepsis.\n- **Surgeons:** If levels are elevated after an operation.\n- **Resuscitators:** For emergency care in critical conditions like sepsis.\n- **Pediatricians:** If abnormalities are detected in children.\n- **Internists:** For overall assessment and management of infections.\n\nThese professionals can guide you through accurate diagnosis and effective treatment plans.\n\nAlways seek medical advice if you notice symptoms linked to severe infections.\n\n#### Sources\n\nThis article was written by doctors from the Docus Medical Research team and reviewed by leading experts in infectious diseases.
