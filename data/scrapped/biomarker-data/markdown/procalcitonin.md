## What Is Procalcitonin?

**Procalcitonin** is a protein made by the thyroid gland. Its levels in the blood are usually very low.

When the body detects a bacterial infection, procalcitonin levels rise sharply. It is then produced in the liver and kidneys.

Procalcitonin is a key biomarker for identifying infections. It helps doctors **diagnose the severity of bacterial infections** and **separate them from viral ones**. It is also useful for monitoring sepsis and guiding treatment decisions.

## When Is Procalcitonin Testing Recommended?

Procalcitonin testing is used when bacterial infections or related complications are suspected. Doctors may prescribe this test to confirm the presence and severity of the condition.

- **Sepsis suspicion:** To detect life-threatening infections that spread throughout the body.
- **Post-surgical complications:** To check for infections following major surgeries.
- **Severe infections:** To evaluate critical infections in the lungs, abdomen, or other areas.
- **Monitoring treatment progress:** To assess the effectiveness of antibiotics or other infection control strategies.
- **Differentiating between infections:** To distinguish bacterial infections from viral ones, which may present similar symptoms.

## How Is Procalcitonin Testing Conducted?

Procalcitonin levels are measured through a [blood test](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview), making the process straightforward and widely accessible. A small sample of blood is drawn from a vein, and advanced techniques are used to analyze it.

- **Test types:** The test is often included in panels like sepsis diagnostic panels or [inflammation markers](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-tests-for-inflammation).
- **Preparation for the test:**
  - Avoid eating for at least 8 hours before the test.
  - In some urgent cases, testing may be performed without preparation.
  - Inform the doctor about any ongoing treatments or health conditions.
- **Testing methods:** An immunochemiluminescent assay is typically used, offering precise and reliable results.

## What Are the Normal Procalcitonin Levels?

Normal procalcitonin levels in healthy adults range from **0.0 to 0.1 ng/ml**.

**Note:** _The units of measurement and the normal ranges can differ depending on the laboratory and the specific methods used. Always consult the report alongside medical advice for proper interpretation._

## What Do High Levels Mean?

High procalcitonin levels indicate the presence of severe infections or related conditions. This biomarker helps in diagnosing the following:

- **Sepsis:** A severe, life-threatening bacterial infection that spreads through the bloodstream.
- **Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS):** A condition caused by infection, trauma, or burns that triggers widespread inflammation.
- **Organ failure:** High levels may indicate multiple organ dysfunction due to severe infections or injury.
- **Surgical complications:** Severe infections post-surgery can elevate procalcitonin levels.
- **Trauma:** Serious physical injuries may result in heightened levels.
- **Transplant rejection:** Elevated procalcitonin levels can signal complications following organ transplants.

### Recommendations

Managing high procalcitonin levels involves addressing the underlying condition. Here are some general recommendations:

- **Seek immediate medical attention:** Prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial.
- **Follow prescribed treatments:** Adhere to all medical instructions provided by your doctor.
- **Monitor progress:** Regular follow-ups and tests ensure the condition is under control.
- **Adopt a healthy lifestyle:** Boost your immune system with proper nutrition and rest.

### Which Specialist Should You Consult?

Depending on the suspected cause, you may need to consult:

- **Infectious disease specialists:** For bacterial infections or sepsis.
- **Surgeons:** If levels are elevated after an operation.
- **Resuscitators:** For emergency care in critical conditions like sepsis.
- **Pediatricians:** If abnormalities are detected in children.
- **Internists:** For overall assessment and management of infections.

These professionals can guide you through accurate diagnosis and effective treatment plans.

Always seek medical advice if you notice symptoms linked to severe infections.
