Neutrophils are vital white blood cells that protect the body by **fighting infections** and **healing damaged tissues**.

They play a crucial role in diagnosing and monitoring health conditions. Their levels indicate immune system activity and potential underlying issues.

## What Are Neutrophils?

Neutrophils are a type of [white blood cell](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/white-blood-cell) and the most prominent component of your immune system.

These cells act as the body's first line of defense against infections by attacking bacteria, viruses, and fungi.

Neutrophils travel quickly to infection sites and release enzymes to destroy harmful microorganisms, playing a vital role in the immune response.

In medical diagnostics, neutrophils are measured to assess the body's ability to combat infections. The **ANC, or absolute neutrophil count**, represents the number of neutrophils present in your blood. It is important for identifying immune system health and diagnosing conditions like infections, inflammation, and some blood disorders.

## When Is Neutrophil Testing Recommended?

Testing for neutrophils is essential in many medical situations to evaluate immune system health. Below are common scenarios where neutrophil testing may be recommended:

- Suspected bacterial or viral infections.
- Persistent or recurring fever.
- Monitoring chemotherapy or radiation therapy effects.
- Assessing immune function in [autoimmune diseases](https://docus.ai/tags/autoimmune-diseases).
- Evaluating bone marrow disorders.
- Diagnosing unexplained fatigue, weakness, or recurrent infections.

## How Is Neutrophil Testing Conducted?

Neutrophil levels are measured using a [blood test](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview). Typically, this test is part of a [complete blood count (CBC)](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/cbc-blood-test), which provides detailed information about various blood components. The **ANC**, or absolute neutrophil count, is calculated by multiplying the total white blood cell count by the percentage of neutrophils and band cells.

### **Preparation for the Test**

- No special preparation is usually required.
- Inform your doctor about any medications or supplements you’re taking, as they may influence test results.
- Avoid strenuous physical activity before the test, as it could temporarily elevate neutrophil levels.

## What Are the Normal Neutrophil Levels?

- **Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC)**: 1,500 to 8,000 cells/µL
- **Neutrophil Percentage**: 40-60% of total white blood cells.

**Note**: _The units of measurement and normal ranges may vary depending on the laboratory and specific testing methods used_

## What Do Abnormal Levels Mean?

### Neutrophil High Levels

High neutrophil levels, or neutrophilia, can occur due to various reasons. This condition indicates an active immune response or inflammation in the body. Common causes include:

- **Bacterial infections**: Neutrophils multiply to combat bacterial invasions.
- **Physical or emotional stress**: Stress can temporarily elevate neutrophil levels.
- **Non-infectious inflammation**: Conditions like rheumatoid arthritis can lead to higher counts.
- **Injury or trauma**: Neutrophils are activated as part of the healing process.
- **Certain chronic diseases**: Such as chronic myeloid leukemia.

#### Recommendations

- Work with your doctor to identify the underlying cause.
- Avoid smoking, as it can increase inflammation.
- Practice stress management techniques like meditation or yoga.
- Maintain a balanced diet rich in anti-inflammatory foods.
- Stay hydrated and get 7-8 hours of quality sleep daily.

### Neutrophil Low Levels

Low neutrophil levels, or neutropenia, suggest a weakened immune system. This can make you more susceptible to infections. Common causes include:

- **Chronic viral infections**: Viruses can suppress bone marrow function.
- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Lack of copper or [vitamin B12](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/vitamin-b12) affects blood production.
- **Bone marrow disorders**: Conditions like aplastic anemia reduce neutrophil production.
- **Autoimmune diseases**: Disorders like lupus may attack neutrophils.

#### Recommendations

- Avoid crowded places to minimize infection risks.
- Practice good hygiene, including frequent hand washing.
- Eat a nutrient-rich diet to support immune function.
- Avoid alcohol, as it can impair bone marrow production.
- Consult a healthcare provider for specialized treatment if neutropenia persists.

### Which Specialist Should You Consult?

If you suspect abnormal neutrophil levels or experience related symptoms, consult a **general practitioner**. They can assess your condition and, if necessary, refer you to a **hematologist** or **immunologist** for further evaluation and treatment.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### \#\#\# What Are Segmented Neutrophils?

Segmented neutrophils are mature neutrophils that play a critical role in fighting infections. They are distinguished by their segmented nucleus, which allows them to move efficiently through blood vessel walls to reach infection sites.

### \#\#\# What Causes High Neutrophils During Pregnancy?

High neutrophils during pregnancy are caused by hormonal changes that boost the immune system to protect both the mother and the baby. This increase helps the body adapt to potential infections and maintain a healthy pregnancy environment.

### \#\#\# What Are Hypersegmented Neutrophils?

Hypersegmented neutrophils are white blood cells with nuclei that have more segments than usual. They are often associated with conditions like vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies.

### \#\#\# Can Low Lymphocytes and High Neutrophils Indicate Cancer?

A combination of low lymphocytes and high neutrophils can sometimes signal the presence of cancer or other serious conditions. This imbalance may occur due to the body’s response to tumors or as a result of treatments like chemotherapy.
