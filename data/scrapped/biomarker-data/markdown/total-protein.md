Total protein levels in the blood can reveal important information about liver and kidney health, nutrition, and immune function. Managing abnormal levels is crucial to prevent complications related to dehydration, chronic diseases, or malnutrition.

## What Is Total Protein?

Total protein is a measure of the overall amount of protein present in your blood. Proteins are essential for many functions in the body, such as building tissues, transporting substances, and fighting infections. The two main types of protein measured are [**albumin**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/albumin) and [**globulin**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/globulin).

**Albumin** helps transport hormones and nutrients, while **globulin** plays a key role in the immune system. Checking total protein levels is often used to help diagnose various diseases or conditions, particularly those related to the [liver](https://docus.ai/tags/liver), kidneys, or immune system.

## When Is Total Protein Testing Recommended?

Total protein testing is commonly used to monitor general health and detect certain conditions. It may be recommended in the following cases:

- To check liver or kidney function
- When there is difficulty urinating or unexplained swelling in the body
- To identify the cause of fluid buildup in the lungs, which may cause shortness of breath
- When an infection or chronic inflammation is suspected
- To investigate blood disorders, such as certain types of [cancer](https://docus.ai/tags/cancer) affecting the blood

## How Is Total Protein Testing Conducted?

Total protein is measured through a [**blood test**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview), which is part of several broader tests, such as a [**comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/metabolic-panel#types-of-metabolic-panels-bmp-and-cmp) or a **basic metabolic panel (BMP)**. During the test, a small blood sample is taken from a vein in your arm and sent to a laboratory for analysis.

**Preparation for the Test**

- **Fasting**: You should not eat for at least 8 hours before the test. Drinking water is allowed.
- **Avoid alcohol**: Refrain from drinking alcohol for 24 hours before the test.
- **Minimize stress**: Stay calm and avoid any physical or emotional stress 30 minutes before the test.
- **No smoking**: Avoid smoking 30 minutes before the test.

## What Are the Normal Total Protein Levels?

Normal total protein levels can vary slightly based on age and health condition. The general normal ranges are:

- **Adults**: 60–83 g/L
- **Children**:

  - 1 year old: 51–73 g/L
  - 3 years old: 56–75 g/L
  - 17 years old: 60–80 g/L

**Note** _: The units of measurement and the normal ranges can differ depending on the laboratory and the specific methods used_

## What Do Abnormal Total Protein Levels Mean?

### Total Protein High Levels

High total protein levels can indicate several underlying conditions. Elevated protein levels may suggest:

- **Dehydration**: A lack of sufficient water in the body can cause higher protein concentrations in the blood.
- **Chronic infections**: Conditions such as hepatitis or tuberculosis can lead to an increase in protein levels.
- **Blood disorders**: Diseases like multiple myeloma or other cancers affecting the blood can result in elevated total protein.
- [**Autoimmune diseases**](https://docus.ai/tags/autoimmune-diseases): Certain immune system disorders can cause higher protein levels due to increased immune activity.

#### Recommendations

- **Increase** [**hydration**](https://docus.ai/tags/hydration): Drink more water to prevent dehydration.
- **Consult a healthcare provider**: To investigate any underlying infections or diseases.
- **Follow medical advice**: For managing chronic conditions, blood disorders, or autoimmune diseases.

### Total Protein Low Levels

Low total protein levels can indicate that the body is not getting enough protein or that there are problems with protein absorption or loss. Possible causes include:

- **Malnutrition**: A diet lacking in sufficient protein can result in low total protein levels.
- **Liver or** [**kidney diseases**](https://docus.ai/tags/kidney-diseases): These organs are responsible for producing and filtering proteins. Damage or disease can lead to lower protein levels.
- **Chronic illnesses**: Conditions like Crohn’s disease or celiac disease can interfere with protein absorption.
- **Post-surgical recovery**: After surgery, the body may need time to restore normal protein levels.

#### Recommendations

- **Improve diet**: Eat more protein-rich foods such as lean meats, beans, and dairy products.
- **Manage chronic diseases**: Work with your healthcare provider to treat conditions affecting protein absorption.
- **Monitor liver and kidney health**: Follow up with regular check-ups to ensure these organs are functioning properly.

### Which Specialist Should You Consult?

If your total protein levels are abnormal, you may need to consult different specialists depending on the underlying cause. Consider seeing:

- A **hepatologist** for liver-related issues
- A **nephrologist** for kidney concerns
- A **gastroenterologist** for digestion and absorption problems
- An **immunologist** if autoimmune diseases are suspected
