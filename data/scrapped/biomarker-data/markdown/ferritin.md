Ferritin is a protein that stores iron, essential for red blood cell production and metabolism.

Ferritin levels help diagnose and manage conditions like **iron deficiency** or **overload**. Understanding ferritin is crucial for maintaining overall health.

## What Is Ferritin?

Ferritin is a protein in your body that stores iron. It acts like a storage container, holding extra iron until your body needs it. [Iron](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/iron) supports red blood cell production, growth, and a healthy metabolism.

Doctors check ferritin levels through a blood test to see if you have too much or too little iron, which can affect your energy, immune system, and overall health.

## When Is Ferritin Testing Recommended?

Ferritin testing helps identify abnormal iron storage, which can cause various health problems. Doctors may recommend the test in the following situations:

- **Persistent fatigue or weakness** to check for iron deficiency anemia.
- **Shortness of breath** or symptoms related to low oxygen levels in the blood.
- **Pale or yellowish skin** as a possible sign of iron-related issues.
- **Unexplained weight loss** to investigate underlying conditions.
- **Irregular heartbeat** or chest discomfort linked to anemia.
- **Hair loss** as a symptom of potential iron deficiency.
- **Frequent infections** that might indicate a compromised immune system due to low iron.
- **Symptoms of chronic diseases** like rheumatoid arthritis, which can impact iron levels.

## How Is Ferritin Testing Conducted?

Ferritin is measured through a simple [blood test](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview).

A healthcare provider draws a small sample from a vein, usually in the arm. This sample is analyzed to determine ferritin levels and assess iron storage.

Tests that may include ferritin levels:

- [**Complete Blood Count (CBC)**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/cbc-blood-test) **:** Examines overall blood health and detects anemia.
- [**Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/metabolic-panel#types-of-metabolic-panels-bmp-and-cmp) **:** Provides information on organ function and overall health.
- **Iron Panel:** Specifically measures ferritin and other markers of iron metabolism.

**Special Preparations for the Test:**

- Avoid eating for at least 8 hours before the test. Drinking water is allowed.
- Refrain from alcohol consumption 24 hours before testing.
- Avoid physical and emotional stress 30 minutes before the test.
- Do not smoke 30 minutes before the test.

## What Are the Normal Ferritin Levels?

Ferritin levels vary by age, sex, and specific conditions such as pregnancy. Below are the standard reference ranges:

**Children**

- Up to 1 year old: 8–182 ng/mL
- Up to 4 years old: 5–100 ng/mL
- Up to 13 years old: 14–79 ng/mL
- Up to 15 years old: 13–83 ng/mL
- Up to 18 years old: 11–172 ng/mL

**Adults**

- **Males:**
  - Up to 59 years old: 38–380 ng/mL
  - Over 59 years old: 24–380 ng/mL
- **Females:**
  - Up to 40 years old: 16–154 ng/mL
  - Up to 60 years old: 16–232 ng/mL
  - Over 60 years old: 16–288 ng/mL

**Pregnant Women**

- First trimester: 6–130 ng/mL
- Second trimester: 2–230 ng/mL
- Third trimester: 0–116 ng/mL

**Note:** _The units of measurement and the normal ranges may differ depending on the laboratory and specific testing methods._

## What Do Abnormal Levels Mean?

### Ferritin High Levels

Elevated ferritin levels may indicate excessive iron storage or other health conditions. Common causes include:

- **Liver diseases:** Such as cirrhosis, which affects iron metabolism.
- **Hemochromatosis:** A genetic disorder causing iron overload.
- **Chronic inflammation or autoimmune disorders:** These can increase ferritin as part of the body's response.
- **Frequent blood transfusions:** Excess iron from transfusions can raise levels.
- **Certain cancers:** Like Hodgkin's lymphoma or leukemia.
- **Excessive iron supplementation:** Overuse of iron tablets or injections.

#### Recommendations

- Work with your doctor to determine the underlying cause.
- Avoid iron-rich foods and supplements unless directed by a doctor.
- Maintain a healthy body weight to reduce inflammation.
- Refrain from smoking and excessive alcohol consumption.

### Ferritin Low Levels

Low ferritin often signals a lack of iron in the body, leading to insufficient [red blood cell](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/rdw-blood-test) production. Common causes include:

- **Iron-deficient diet:** Inadequate intake of iron-rich foods.
- **Poor absorption:** Conditions like celiac disease or certain medications can hinder iron absorption.
- [**Heavy menstrual bleeding**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/8-types-of-abnormal-menstruation) **:** This can significantly lower iron stores.
- **Chronic blood loss:** From ulcers or gastrointestinal issues.
- **Iron deficiency anemia:** A common outcome of prolonged low ferritin levels.

#### Recommendations

- Increase intake of iron-rich foods, such as lean meats, leafy greens, and legumes.
- Pair iron-rich foods with vitamin C to enhance absorption.
- Address any underlying health issues causing blood loss or poor absorption.
- Follow your doctor’s guidance on iron supplementation if necessary.

### Which Specialist Should You Consult?

For abnormal ferritin levels, consult the following specialists:

- **Primary care physician:** For initial evaluation and general management.
- **Hematologist:** If ferritin levels suggest blood disorders or anemia.
- **Gastroenterologist:** If the issue involves poor iron absorption or gastrointestinal bleeding.
- **Endocrinologist:** For hormonal or metabolic conditions impacting ferritin.
