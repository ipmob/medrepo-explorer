DHEA-S is a vital biomarker that helps regulate hormonal balance and serves as a precursor to sex hormones.

DHEA-S helps diagnose adrenal and hormonal disorders and provides insights into reproductive and overall health. Understanding its levels is key to managing various health conditions effectively.

## What Is DHEA-S?

Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) is a steroid hormone produced primarily by the adrenal glands. It is derived from dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and serves as a precursor for the production of sex hormones such as [estrogen](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/estrogen) and [testosterone](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/estrogen).

DHEA-S plays several critical roles in the body:

- Supports cognitive function.
- Aids in the development of the reproductive system.
- Contributes to overall hormonal balance.

This biomarker helps assess adrenal gland function and diagnose hormonal disorders. It can also reveal causes of symptoms like abnormal hair growth, early puberty, or reproductive health changes.

## When Is DHEA-S Testing Recommended?

DHEA-S testing is not routine but may be recommended if symptoms suggest a hormone imbalance. It helps evaluate adrenal gland function or detect androgen abnormalities.

Here are some situations where DHEA-S testing might be prescribed:

- **Signs of early puberty** in boys or girls, such as rapid physical development.
- **Unexplained excessive body hair growth** (hirsutism), particularly in women.
- **Symptoms of adrenal dysfunction**, such as persistent fatigue, low blood pressure, or weight changes.
- **Bronze discoloration of the skin** unrelated to sun exposure.
- **Reproductive health concerns**, such as irregular menstrual cycles or testicular issues.
- **Suspected adrenal tumors or hyperplasia**, especially when combined with other hormonal imbalances.

## What Are the Normal DHEA-S Levels?

Normal DHEA-S levels vary based on age, and gender. Here are the general reference ranges:

| Age | Female (µmol/L) | Male (µmol/L) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| < 1 week | 2.93 - 16.5 | 2.93 - 16.5 |
| 1 - 4 weeks | 0.86 - 11.7 | 0.86 - 11.7 |
| 4 weeks - 1 year | 0.09 - 3.35 | 0.09 - 3.35 |
| 1 - 5 years | 0.01 - 0.53 | 0.01 - 0.53 |
| 5 - 10 years | 0.08 - 2.31 | 0.08 - 2.31 |
| 10 - 15 years | 0.92 - 7.60 | 0.66 - 6.70 |
| 15 - 20 years | 1.77 - 9.99 | 1.91 - 13.40 |
| 20 - 25 years | 4.02 - 11.0 | 5.73 - 13.40 |
| 25 - 35 years | 2.68 - 9.23 | 4.34 - 12.20 |
| 35 - 45 years | 1.65 - 9.15 | 2.41 - 11.60 |
| 45 - 55 years | 0.96 - 6.95 | 1.20 - 8.98 |
| 55 - 65 years | 0.51 - 5.56 | 1.40 - 8.01 |
| 65 - 75 years | 0.26 - 6.68 | 0.91 - 6.76 |
| \> 75 years | 0.33 - 4.18 | 0.44 - 3.34 |

**Note:** _The units of measurement and the normal ranges can differ depending on the laboratory and the specific methods used._

## What Do Abnormal Levels Mean?

### DHEA-S High Levels

Elevated DHEA-S levels suggest an overproduction of this hormone, often linked to underlying conditions. Common causes include:

- **Adrenal hyperplasia:** A congenital condition causing the adrenal glands to overproduce hormones.
- **Adrenal tumors or cancer:** Growths in the adrenal gland that can lead to excessive hormone secretion.
- [**Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/pcos-overview) **:** A hormonal disorder in women that affects the ovaries.
- **Hypothalamic-pituitary system dysfunction:** Abnormal signaling from the brain that leads to hormone imbalances.
- **Rare ovarian tumors:** Occasionally, ovarian tumors can produce excess DHEA-S.

#### Recommendations

- Work with your healthcare provider to identify the underlying cause.
- Avoid smoking, as it may exacerbate hormonal imbalances.
- Discontinue any DHEA supplements unless prescribed by a doctor.
- Manage stress levels through relaxation techniques like meditation or yoga.

### DHEA-S Low Levels

Low levels of DHEA-S can indicate insufficient production by the adrenal glands or other underlying conditions. Common causes include:

- **Adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease):** A condition where the adrenal glands do not produce enough hormones.
- **Adrenal dysfunction:** General poor functioning of the adrenal glands.
- **Hypopituitarism:** A condition where the pituitary gland fails to signal hormone production effectively.
- **Medication side effects:** Certain medications, such as corticosteroids, can lower DHEA-S levels.

#### Recommendations

- Consult your doctor to determine the specific cause of the deficiency.
- Incorporate stress-reducing activities into your daily routine.
- Discuss with your doctor whether lifestyle changes, such as dietary adjustments, or supplements are necessary.

### Which Specialist Should You Consult?

If you have abnormal DHEA-S levels, the following specialists can provide appropriate care:

- **Endocrinologist:** For hormone-related issues and adrenal gland evaluations.
- **Oncologist:** If tumors or cancer are suspected as the underlying cause.
