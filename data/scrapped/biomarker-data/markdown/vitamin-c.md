## What Is Vitamin C?

Vitamin C, or ascorbic acid, is an important nutrient needed for many body functions. It helps make collagen, which keeps skin healthy and supports wound healing. It also improves iron absorption, boosts the immune system, and repairs tissues.

As a strong antioxidant, Vitamin C protects cells from damage. Doctors check Vitamin C levels to assess nutrition, diagnose deficiencies, and manage conditions like scurvy or high oxidative stress.

## When Is Vitamin C Testing Recommended?

Testing Vitamin C levels is typically recommended when symptoms of deficiency or excess are suspected. This test can provide valuable insights into a person’s nutritional and health status.

Common situations when testing may be prescribed:

- Signs of **Vitamin C deficiency**, such as bleeding gums or frequent infections.
- Symptoms of **scurvy**, including fatigue, joint pain, or bruising.
- Chronic conditions that may impair nutrient absorption, such as **Crohn's disease**, **celiac disease**, and **chronic pancreatitis**.
- Monitoring nutritional status before implementing specific dietary plans.
- Suspected **malabsorption disorders** or **gastrointestinal issues**.

## How Is Vitamin C Testing Conducted?

Vitamin C levels are measured through a simple [blood test](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview). A sample of venous blood is collected for laboratory analysis. The test commonly uses high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to ensure accurate results.

Vitamin C measurements are often included as part of comprehensive [nutritional panels](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/nutritional-tests). They can also be part of specific vitamin deficiency panels, offering insights into an individual’s nutritional health.

**Preparation for the test:**

- Avoid taking Vitamin C supplements or multivitamins **48 hours before the test** to ensure accurate results.
- Fasting may not be required unless the doctor advises otherwise.

## What Are the Normal Vitamin C Levels?

Normal Vitamin C levels in the blood are typically measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or micrograms per milliliter (mcg/ml).

- **For females**: 0.3–2.7 mg/dL (3–27 mcg/ml).
- **For males**: 0.2–2.1 mg/dL (2–21 mcg/ml).

**Note:** _The units of measurement and the normal ranges can differ depending on the laboratory and the specific methods used._

## What Do Low Levels Mean?

Low levels of Vitamin C, also known as **hypovitaminosis C**, are common and can lead to serious health issues if left untreated.

**Causes of low Vitamin C levels:**

- **Poor diet**: Insufficient intake of fruits and vegetables rich in Vitamin C.
- **Smoking and alcohol consumption**: These habits increase the body’s Vitamin C requirements.
- **Malabsorption disorders**: Conditions like Crohn’s disease or celiac disease can impair Vitamin C absorption.
- **Chronic illnesses**: Conditions such as hyperthyroidism or kidney disease may deplete Vitamin C levels.
- **Scurvy**: A severe deficiency that results in symptoms like bleeding gums, fatigue, and joint pain.

### Recommendations

- Include Vitamin C-rich foods in your diet, such as **oranges**, **strawberries**, **bell peppers**, and **broccoli**.
- Reduce smoking and alcohol intake to prevent depletion.
- Consult a healthcare professional to address underlying conditions like malabsorption.

### Which Specialist Should You Consult?

If you suspect abnormal Vitamin C levels, consult a healthcare professional to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment. Specialists who may help include:

- **Physicians**: For general diagnosis and management of nutritional deficiencies.
- **Pediatricians**: If the concern involves children.
- **Hematologists**: For conditions affecting blood health.
- **Dermatologists**: If skin health is significantly impacted.
- **Oncologists**: For patients undergoing cancer treatments that may affect Vitamin C levels.
