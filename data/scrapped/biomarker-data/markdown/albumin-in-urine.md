## What Is Albumin in Urine?

[**Albumin**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/albumin) is a **protein produced by the liver** and is one of the main proteins found in blood serum. It plays several vital roles in the body, such as maintaining fluid balance, transporting essential nutrients, and supporting tissue repair.

While albumin typically remains in the bloodstream, small amounts can occasionally enter the urine.

When albumin appears in higher-than-normal amounts in urine, it may signal kidney issues. Kidneys are responsible for filtering waste while retaining essential substances like proteins. When they are damaged, proteins like albumin can leak into urine, a condition known as albuminuria.

## When Is Albumin in Urine Testing Recommended?

Albumin testing in urine is recommended when there’s a potential risk or concern for kidney health. This test is a valuable tool in monitoring and diagnosing kidney-related conditions, especially in patients with chronic illnesses. It’s typically ordered in the following cases:

- [**Type 1 Diabetes**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/type-1-vs-type-2-diabetes): After five years of diagnosis, with regular testing every six months.
- [**Type 2 Diabetes**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/type-1-vs-type-2-diabetes): Every six months to check for early signs of kidney disease.
- **Juvenile Diabetes with Unstable Blood Sugar Levels**: Especially in young patients, regular monitoring can catch kidney issues early.
- **Pregnancy with Nephropathy Symptoms**: If there are signs of kidney issues, albumin testing helps monitor kidney health.
- **Suspected Glomerulonephritis**: To diagnose early stages of inflammation in the kidney’s filtering units.
- **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus or Amyloidosis**: For early detection of kidney damage caused by these conditions.
- **High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)**: To monitor potential kidney complications from prolonged high blood pressure.
- **Post-Kidney Transplant**: To track kidney function and detect signs of rejection.

## How Is Albumin in Urine Testing Conducted?

Albumin levels can be assessed both through urine and blood tests. While [blood tests](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview) are often used to check albumin levels in general, urine tests are specifically helpful in assessing kidney health and identifying early signs of kidney damage.

Albumin levels in urine are typically measured through a [**urinalysis**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/urinalysis-test). This can be either a one-time spot test or a 24-hour urine collection, depending on what the healthcare provider needs to assess.

There are several test methods to measure albumin in urine. One common method is the **turbidimetric test**, which uses light to detect the concentration of albumin in the urine sample. In some cases, a **urine dipstick test** may also be used for a quick initial screening.

**Preparing for the Test**

To ensure the accuracy of albumin testing in urine, some preparations may be needed:

- **Avoid heavy exercise** before the test, as intense physical activity can temporarily increase albumin levels.
- **Stay hydrated**, but don’t overconsume fluids, as excessive hydration can dilute urine and affect results.
- **Limit protein intake** in the days leading up to the test to avoid influencing albumin readings.
- **Follow specific instructions** from your healthcare provider if other guidelines are provided.

## What Are the Normal Albumin Levels in Urine?

Normal albumin levels in urine are generally low, as the kidneys are usually effective at retaining proteins.

For **adults**, the typical reference range is:

- **0 to 20 mg/L**

**Note:** _The units of measurement and the normal ranges can differ depending on the laboratory and the specific methods used._

## What Do High Levels Mean?

High levels of albumin in urine, known as **albuminuria**, often indicate that the kidneys are not filtering properly. This can be a sign of kidney damage or stress on the kidneys. Various factors and conditions can cause elevated albumin levels in urine, such as:

- **Dehydration**: When the body lacks sufficient fluids, it may concentrate urine, leading to higher albumin levels.
- **High-Protein Diet**: Consuming excessive amounts of protein may temporarily raise albumin levels in the urine.
- **Intense Physical Activity**: Strenuous exercise can stress the kidneys, sometimes causing temporary increases in albumin excretion.
- [**Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)**](https://docus.ai/tags/uti): Inflammation in the urinary tract, like cystitis or urethritis, can cause albumin levels to rise.
- **High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)**: Prolonged high blood pressure can damage kidney tissues, leading to protein leakage into the urine.
- **Chronic Inflammatory Conditions**: Systemic inflammation from conditions such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis can impact kidney function.
- **Kidney Artery Narrowing**: When arteries supplying blood to the kidneys narrow, it can stress the kidneys and lead to elevated albumin.

### Recommendations

If albumin levels are found to be high, lifestyle changes and treatment plans can help manage and reduce these levels. Here are some tips to maintain kidney health and prevent albumin leakage:

- **Work with a healthcare provider** to investigate and treat the underlying cause of high albumin.
- **Follow a balanced, low-protein diet** that suits your body’s needs without overloading the kidneys.
- **Stay hydrated** by drinking adequate water, which supports kidney function.
- **Incorporate regular exercise** into your routine to improve blood pressure and support overall kidney health.
- **Quit smoking** if applicable, as smoking can worsen kidney function over time.
- **Consider vitamin D supplementation** if advised by your healthcare provider, as it may support kidney health.
- **Prioritize sleep** and manage stress, both of which can positively impact kidney health.
- **Reduce salt intake**, as excess sodium can elevate blood pressure and strain the kidneys.

### Which Specialist Should You Consult?

If albumin levels in urine are elevated or there’s a concern about kidney health, it’s best to consult a medical professional who specializes in kidney function and related health issues. The following healthcare providers can assist in diagnosing and managing elevated albumin levels in urine:

- **General Practitioner (GP)**: For initial testing and guidance.
- **Nephrologist**: A kidney specialist who can conduct in-depth assessments and create a treatment plan if there’s kidney damage.
- **Endocrinologist**: If [diabetes](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/diabetes) is the underlying cause, an endocrinologist can help manage blood sugar and reduce stress on the kidneys.
- **Urologist**: For issues involving the urinary tract, such as infections or inflammation.
- **Gynecologist**: For pregnancy-related kidney concerns, especially in cases with signs of nephropathy.
