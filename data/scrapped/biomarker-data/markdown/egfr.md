**Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)** is a vital marker for assessing kidney health. It helps measure kidney function, diagnose chronic kidney disease, and monitor overall health.

EGFR levels can help with early treatment and better kidney health.

## What Is eGFR?

Estimated glomerular filtration rate **(eGFR)** is a crucial measure of how well your kidneys are functioning.

It evaluates the kidneys' ability to filter waste products and excess fluids from your blood. That is essential for maintaining a healthy balance of minerals and nutrients in your body.

By calculating eGFR, healthcare providers can identify potential kidney issues and monitor the progression of kidney diseases. It is especially useful in diagnosing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and assessing kidney function in at-risk individuals.

## When Is eGFR Testing Recommended?

eGFR testing is typically recommended when there are concerns about kidney health. Doctors may prescribe this test in the following situations:

- **Symptoms of kidney problems:** Issues like swelling, fatigue, or changes in urination may indicate kidney dysfunction.
- **Monitoring chronic conditions:** For individuals with [diabetes](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/diabetes) or high blood pressure, regular eGFR testing helps track kidney health.
- **Abnormal** [**urinalysis**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/urinalysis-test) **results:** Impurities, protein, or [blood in the urine](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/blood-in-urine) can trigger the need for eGFR testing.
- **Family history of kidney disease:** Individuals with a genetic predisposition may undergo testing as a precaution.
- **Routine health checkups:** Some screenings include eGFR tests to ensure overall kidney health.

## How Is eGFR Testing Conducted?

eGFR is determined through a [blood test](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview) that measures the level of [creatinine](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/creatinine-key-insights), a waste product generated by muscle activity.

This creatinine value is then used in a formula that accounts for factors like **age**, **sex**, and **race** to estimate kidney function.

Types of test:

- [**Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/metabolic-panel) **:** This includes eGFR as part of a broader health assessment.
- **Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP):** Focuses on kidney function and electrolyte balance, including eGFR.

### Preparations for the Test

- Avoid intense physical activity before the test, as it may affect creatinine levels.
- Stay well-hydrated, but avoid overhydration, as it could dilute blood samples.
- Inform your doctor about any supplements or medications you are taking, as some may influence results.

## What Are the Normal eGFR Levels?

A normal eGFR is generally **above 90**. However, values above 60 may still be considered normal, provided there are no additional signs of kidney disease.

**Note:** _The units of measurement and the normal ranges can differ depending on the laboratory and the specific methods used_

## What Do Low Levels Mean?

Low eGFR levels indicate reduced kidney function, which could stem from various causes:

- **Dehydration:** Insufficient fluid intake can temporarily reduce kidney function.
- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD):** Progressive damage to the kidneys impairs filtration efficiency.
- **Glomerulonephritis:** Inflammation in the kidney's filtering units affects function.
- **Urolithiasis (kidney stones):** Stones can obstruct normal kidney activity.
- **Pyelonephritis:** A severe kidney infection that impacts filtration ability.
- **Massive blood loss:** Can reduce blood flow to the kidneys, impairing their function.

### Recommendations

To improve low eGFR levels and support kidney health, consider these steps:

- Stay hydrated by drinking adequate amounts of water daily.
- Maintain a healthy body weight through regular physical activity.
- Avoid smoking and limit alcohol consumption.
- Follow a plant-based diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
- Balance protein intake to avoid overloading the kidneys.
- Include omega-3 fatty acids in your diet to reduce inflammation.
- Consult your doctor for tailored advice based on your specific condition.

### Which Specialist Should You Consult?

If your eGFR levels are abnormal, it is essential to consult a healthcare specialist.

- **Nephrologist:** A kidney specialist who can diagnose and treat kidney-related conditions.
- **Urologist:** A doctor specializing in urinary tract issues, including kidney stones and infections.

These specialists will guide you in managing your condition effectively and preventing further complications.

## Frequently Asked Questions with Answers

### \#\#\# What is the role of eGFR in cancer treatment?

eGFR can be significant in cancer treatment, particularly in evaluating kidney function before and during therapy. Certain chemotherapy drugs may require dose adjustments based on eGFR to avoid kidney damage.

### \#\#\# How does an anti-eGFR antibody work?

Anti-eGFR antibodies are used in targeted cancer therapies. They block the activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which can slow down or stop the growth of certain cancer cells.

### \#\#\# Can eGFR levels cause skin rash symptoms?

While eGFR itself does not cause skin rashes, treatments targeting EGFR, such as anti-EGFR antibodies, can lead to skin rashes as a side effect.

### \#\#\# What is the difference between eGFR and CrCl?

eGFR estimates kidney filtration using a formula that includes creatinine levels, while CrCl (creatinine clearance) directly measures creatinine levels in both blood and urine to assess kidney function.

### \#\#\# What is an eGFR gene mutation?

An eGFR gene mutation refers to changes in the EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) gene, often linked to cancer development, particularly in lung cancer.

### \#\#\# What causes mutations in the eGFR gene?

Mutations in the eGFR gene may arise from genetic predisposition, environmental factors like smoking, or prolonged exposure to carcinogens.

### \#\#\# Is an eGFR mutation hereditary?

Some eGFR mutations can be hereditary, but others may occur spontaneously or be caused by environmental factors.

### \#\#\# How is eGFR mutation testing done?

eGFR mutation testing is typically performed using a biopsy or blood sample analyzed for specific genetic changes in the EGFR gene.

### \#\#\# What are the types of eGFR mutations?

Common types include activating mutations, such as exon 19 deletions or exon 21 point mutations, which are often linked to cancer and can affect treatment options.
