## What is Considered a Fever During Pregnancy?

The average body temperature for a healthy adult, including pregnant women, typically ranges from **97°F to 99°F**(36.1°C to 37.2°C). Small variations can occur based on the time of day and specific activities undertaken.

**During pregnancy**, a body temperature **of 100.4°F**(38°C) **or higher** is generally considered a fever. It's important to monitor this closely, as maintaining a normal temperature is crucial for the health of both the mother and the developing fetus.

According to [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/could-fever-harm-my-baby#How-will-a-fever-affect-my-baby), persistent or high fevers during pregnancy require medical attention due to potential risks to both mother and baby.

## Causes of Fever When Pregnant

Fever in pregnant women can be triggered by various infections such as:

- **[Urinary tract infections](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/bladder-infection-vs-uti) (UTIs)**

- **Colds and flu**

- **Respiratory tract infections**

These are common during pregnancy due to **changes in the immune system** that make women more susceptible to infections.

Besides infections, fever can also result from non-infectious causes such as **dehydration**, **overheating from external temperatures**, or **excessive exercise**.

It's vital to identify the cause of the fever to address it appropriately and prevent any potential harm to the pregnancy.

## How to Get Rid of a Fever Naturally?

**Safe Natural Remedies for Managing Fever in Pregnancy:**

- Hydration: Drink plenty of fluids like water, herbal teas, and broths to help reduce body temperature and prevent dehydration.
- Rest: Ensure ample rest as it helps the body fight off infection and recover more quickly.
- Cool Compresses: Apply a cool cloth to the forehead, back of the neck, or wrists to help reduce body temperature.
- Light Clothing: Wear light and breathable clothing to allow body heat to escape and cool down naturally.
- Room Temperature: Keep the room at a comfortable temperature; avoid overheating the environment.

**Tips on When to Seek Medical Attention for a Fever During Pregnancy:**

- Temperature Monitoring: If your temperature reaches 100.4°F (38°C) or higher and does not reduce with natural methods, seek medical advice.
- Persistent Fever: If the fever lasts more than 24 hours or is accompanied by other symptoms such as a rash, severe headache, or persistent vomiting, consult your healthcare provider.
- Unusual Symptoms: Immediate medical attention is required if experiencing symptoms like severe abdominal pain, trouble breathing, or confusion.
