## Causes of Pain After Root Canal

A root canal is a dental procedure designed to **treat infection in the pulp** of a tooth. This treatment can save the tooth and prevent further complications.

Pain after a root canal can be due to:

- **Inflammation** in the area surrounding the treated tooth.
- **Infection** that persists or develops after the procedure.
- The **natural healing process** causing temporary discomfort.
- **Sensitivity** in the tissues around the treated tooth.

Complications such as **residual infection**, a **cracked tooth**, or an **incomplete procedure** can cause pain.

Another possibility is an **[allergic reaction](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/allergy-attack)** to the materials used.

If pain is severe or persistent, it may indicate a problem. Observing symptoms like swelling, [fever](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/when-to-go-to-the-hospital-for-fever), or a bad taste in the mouth can help identify the cause.

## How Long is Pain After Root Canal?

Pain after a root canal usually lasts a **few days**. It should gradually decrease as the tooth and surrounding tissue heal.

**Factors that influence the length** of recovery time:

- Severity of the initial infection.
- Complexity of the root canal procedure.
- Overall health and healing capacity of the patient.

Some people may experience pain for a shorter or longer time depending on their **pain tolerance** and **healing response**.

If the pain lasts **longer than a week** or becomes more intense, consult your dentist. They may need to re-evaluate the treated tooth for any issues.

## How to Stop Throbbing Pain After Root Canal?

**Common home remedies for managing root canal pain**:

- Apply a cold compress to the outside of your cheek near the affected area.
- Rinse your mouth with warm salt water to reduce inflammation and pain.

Follow any medication advice given by your dentist to manage pain effectively.

**Recommended lifestyle changes to manage pain**:

- Avoid chewing on the side of your mouth where the procedure was done.
- Stick to soft foods and avoid very hot or cold items.

**When to seek professional dental help**:

- If the throbbing pain is severe and doesn't improve after a few days.
- If you experience swelling, fever, or an unpleasant taste in your mouth.
