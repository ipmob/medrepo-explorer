## What is PCOS?

[Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/pcos-overview) is a common hormonal disorder affecting **7-10%** of women of reproductive age, as per the [Endocrine Society](https://www.endocrine.org/patient-engagement/endocrine-library/pcos#:~:text=Polycystic%20ovary%20syndrome%20(PCOS)%20is,6%20million%20women%20have%20PCOS.). It is characterized by irregular menstrual cycles, excess androgen levels, and polycystic ovaries.

Additionally, PCOS can lead to skin problems like [acne](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/pcos-acne) and excess hair growth. Long-term health risks include type 2 diabetes and heart disease. PCOS can lead to various health issues if not managed properly.

**The exact cause of PCOS is unknown**, but it is believed to be linked to genetic and environmental factors. Insulin resistance, elevated levels of male hormones, and inflammation are also associated with PCOS development. Lifestyle and diet can influence the severity of the condition.

**The most common symptoms include**:

- [Irregular or absent menstrual periods](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/8-types-of-abnormal-menstruation)
- Weight gain or difficulty losing weight
- Excess hair growth on the face, chest, and back (hirsutism)
- [Acne](https://docus.ai/tags/acne) and oily skin
- Hair thinning or male-pattern baldness
- Darkening of the skin, particularly around the neck, groin, [thighs](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/pcos-dark-inner-thighs) and under the breasts
- Fertility problems due to irregular ovulation

## What is Endometriosis?

According to the [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/endometriosis), [endometriosis](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/endometriosis-explained) is a chronic condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus. This misplaced tissue can cause pain, inflammation, and the formation of scar tissue. Endometriosis often affects the **ovaries**, **fallopian tubes**, and **pelvic lining**.

The exact cause of endometriosis is unclear, but it may involve genetic, hormonal, and immune system factors. Retrograde menstruation, where menstrual blood flows backward into the pelvic cavity, is one possible explanation. Environmental factors might also play a role.

The condition may cause adhesions and cysts in the pelvic area, complicating treatment and management.

**Endometriosis [symptoms](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/uncommon-symptoms-of-endometriosis) vary in severity but often include**:

- Chronic [pelvic pain](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/stabbing-pain-in-pelvic-area-in-females), especially during menstruation
- Pain extending to the lower back and abdomen
- Heavy menstrual bleeding or [bleeding between periods](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/bleeding-before-period)
- Pain during intercourse (dyspareunia)
- Pain during bowel movements or urination, especially during menstrual periods
- [Fatigue](https://docus.ai/tags/fatigue), diarrhea, constipation, bloating, and nausea
- Fertility issues, making it difficult to conceive

## Can You Have PCOS and Endometriosis Simultaneously?

**Yes, it is possible to have both [PCOS and endometriosis](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/pcos-vs-endometriosis) simultaneously.** These conditions affect different aspects of reproductive health and can coexist.

Actually, a [study](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/100/3/911/2839432) from the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism suggests that **women with PCOS were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with endometriosis**. Specifically, **36.4%** of women with PCOS had endometriosis compared to just **4.4%** of women without PCOS.

In fact, researchers from Central South University and Changsha Jiangwan Maternity Hospital examined the shared genetic architecture between endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome and [found](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2024.1359236/full) that endometriosis and PCOS have some of the same genetic factors. This means that the same genes may influence the development of both conditions.

PCOS primarily involves hormonal imbalances, irregular menstrual cycles, and metabolic issues. Endometriosis involves the growth of tissue similar to the uterine lining outside the uterus, causing pain and other symptoms. Having both conditions can complicate diagnosis and treatment, as symptoms may overlap.

For example, the same study suggests **both endometriosis and PCOS can lead to infertility and miscarriage, and they exhibit similar hormonal dysregulation**, such as increased estrogen activity and progesterone resistance. These similarities contribute to intersecting clinical presentations.

It is important to work with a healthcare provider to manage both conditions effectively. Combining treatments for PCOS and endometriosis can help improve quality of life and reduce symptoms.
