## When to go to the hospital for a fever?

Adults should head to the hospital for fevers reaching **104°F (40°C)** or **higher** that don't reduce with over-the-counter medications.

If the fever persists or does not start to decrease within **two hours after medication**, it's important to seek medical attention.

**Specific Symptoms**: Look for urgent symptoms accompanying a fever that demand immediate hospital care:

- Severe headache
- Stiff neck

These could be signs of a serious condition.

## When should I take my 2-year-old to the hospital for a fever?

Fevers in toddlers can signal serious issues, so careful monitoring is crucial.

**Hospitalize your child if** they show any of the following:

- Fever over 102°F (38.9°C)
- Severe lethargy
- Difficulty breathing
- Signs of dehydration (e.g., no wet diapers)
- [Rash](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/baby-neck-rash)
