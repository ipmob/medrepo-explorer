## What are Tubular Breasts?

[Tubular breasts](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/tubular-breasts), also known as **tuberous breasts**, are a condition where the breasts develop abnormally during puberty. They often have a narrow base, are elongated, and have a high placement on the chest. The areola may appear **larger** and **more prominent**. This condition can affect one or both breasts, leading to asymmetry.

“ _The exact causes of tubular breasts are not entirely clear, but they are believed to be a result of a developmental anomaly during puberty and genetic factors may also play a role_”, states a plastic surgeon Dr. Banwell in his [interview](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/body/a45322757/tubular-breasts/) with Cosmopolitan.

**Hormonal factors** may play a role in the abnormal development of the breast tissue. Tubular breasts do not usually affect breast function or overall health, but they can impact self-esteem and body image.

## What is PCOS?

[Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/pcos-overview) is a hormonal disorder common among women of reproductive age. It is characterized by [irregular menstrual periods](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/8-types-of-abnormal-menstruation#types-of-abnormal-menstruation), excess androgen levels (male hormones), and polycystic ovaries. Symptoms include weight gain, [acne](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/pcos-acne), excessive hair growth, and difficulty getting pregnant. Women with PCOS may also experience thinning hair

According to the Penn State World Student Affairs [data](https://studentaffairs.psu.edu/health-wellness/healthcare-and-medical-services/health-information-resources/polycystic-ovary#:~:text=Polycystic%20ovary%20syndrome%20(PCOS)%20is,their%20overall%20health%20and%20appearance.), PCOS affects approximately **1 in 10 women** of childbearing age. Risk factors include a family history of PCOS, obesity, and insulin resistance.

**The exact cause of PCOS is not fully understood**, but it involves a combination of **genetic** and **environmental factors**. Early diagnosis and treatment can help manage symptoms and reduce the risk of complications.

## How are Tubular Breasts and PCOS Connected?

**There is no direct evidence that links tubular breasts with PCOS**.

Tubular breasts are a congenital condition related to breast development, while PCOS is a hormonal disorder affecting the ovaries. However, both conditions involve hormonal factors, which may suggest some indirect connection.

Hormonal imbalances are a key feature of PCOS, leading to symptoms like irregular periods and excess androgen levels. These hormonal changes can impact overall development and body features.

**While tubular breasts are not caused by PCOS, hormonal imbalances in PCOS might influence breast tissue development in some cases.**
