## IUD vs Birth Control Pill: Overview

[IUDs](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/iud-vs-implant#understanding-larcs-iuds-and-implants) and birth control pills are popular methods for preventing pregnancy. Both serve the primary purpose of [birth control](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/birth-control-options) but function differently.

**How They Work**: IUDs are small devices placed inside the **uterus** to prevent sperm from fertilizing an egg. Birth control pills contain **hormones** that prevent ovulation, which stops the release of an egg.

**[Types](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/iud-vs-implant#in-depth-the-intrauterine-device-iud) Available**: IUDs come in hormonal and non-hormonal types. **Hormonal** IUDs release hormones, while **non-hormonal** IUDs use copper to prevent pregnancy. Birth control pills are available in combination pills, containing both estrogen and progestin, and progestin-only pills.

**Usage**: An IUD is inserted by a healthcare provider and can remain effective for several years. Birth control pills must be taken daily at the same time to be effective.

## Pill vs IUD: Effectiveness

Effectiveness is a crucial factor when choosing a birth control method. High effectiveness ensures better prevention of unintended pregnancies.

**Effectiveness of IUD**:

- Over **99%** effective in preventing pregnancy, as per [Yale Medicine](https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/intrauterine-devices-iud).
- Minimal user error maintains high effectiveness.

**Effectiveness of Birth Control Pills**:

- Planned Parenthood [states](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-pill/how-effective-is-the-birth-control-pill) that it is about **93%** effective with typical use.
- Effectiveness decreases with missed doses or incorrect use.

**Factors Influencing Effectiveness**: The consistency of use greatly affects the effectiveness of both methods. IUDs eliminate user error, while pills require strict adherence to **daily intake**. User error can significantly decrease the effectiveness of birth control pills.

## IUD vs Pill: Side Effects

Understanding the side effects of birth control methods is important for making an informed choice. Both IUDs and pills have potential side effects.
