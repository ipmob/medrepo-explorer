## How to Stop Shaking from an Anxiety Attack?

During an [anxiety](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/how-to-recognize-anxiety-in-yourself-and-others) attack, you may experience shaking, sweating, and a racing heartbeat. Recognizing the symptoms helps identify what's happening and focus on immediate grounding techniques, like touching familiar objects or looking around to observe five different items.

- **Breathing Exercises**: Controlled breathing is crucial in reducing shaking. Practice slow, deep breaths, inhaling for four counts, holding for four, and exhaling for four. Repeat this cycle until the shaking eases.
- **Cognitive Techniques**: Challenge catastrophic thoughts by focusing on positive affirmations or rational counterarguments. Engage in activities like counting backward or visualizing a safe space to distract your mind from spiraling thoughts.
- **Professional Help**: Consider seeking advice from a healthcare professional if shaking persists or becomes debilitating. Therapy or medication can offer further assistance.

## How to Stop Shaking from Anxiety at Night?

Anxiety often peaks at night due to fewer distractions and more quiet time for worrying thoughts.

- **Sleep Hygiene**: Establishing a consistent pre-bed routine helps signal to your body it's time to rest. Avoid stimulants like caffeine or bright screens an hour before bedtime.
- **Relaxation Techniques**: Progressive muscle relaxation or a warm bath before sleep can calm the body, reducing anxiety-induced shaking. Pair this with gentle stretching or calming music.
- **Mindful Practices**: Mindfulness shifts focus from anxious thoughts to the present moment. Techniques like guided meditation, deep breathing, or gratitude journaling can help refocus.
- **Professional Support**: If nighttime anxiety persists despite self-help strategies, a mental health professional can offer tailored guidance.

## How to Stop Shaking from Anxiety Naturally?

- **Breathing Techniques**: Practice deep breathing exercises like diaphragmatic breathing or the 4-7-8 technique to calm the nervous system and reduce shaking.
- **Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR)**: Gradually tense and then relax different muscle groups in the body to release tension and promote relaxation.
- **Meditation and Mindfulness**: Engage in mindfulness practices like guided meditation to help center your thoughts and reduce anxiety.
- **Exercise**: Engage in physical activities like yoga, stretching, or cardio to burn off excess adrenaline and release endorphins.
- **Balanced Diet**: Eat foods rich in vitamins, minerals, and omega-3 fatty acids that support brain health and reduce anxiety symptoms.
- **Herbal Supplements**: Consider natural supplements like chamomile, valerian root, or passionflower under the guidance of a healthcare provider.
- **Limit Stimulants**: Reduce consumption of caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol, which can exacerbate anxiety and shaking.
- **Aromatherapy**: Use calming essential oils like lavender, bergamot, or frankincense in a diffuser or as part of a massage.
- **Regular Sleep**: Maintain a consistent sleep schedule to restore balance and resilience to your nervous system.
- **Cognitive-Behavioral Techniques**: Challenge negative thought patterns and practice positive affirmations to reduce mental stress.

## What Tea is Good for Anxiety?

**Chamomile tea** is widely recognized for its soothing properties. **Lavender tea** can also calm the mind, and valerian root tea is known to promote better sleep and ease restlessness.

**Ingredients to Look For**: Seek out teas containing calming ingredients like chamomile, lavender, lemon balm, or passionflower. These herbs are traditionally used to alleviate anxiety.

**Preparation and Consumption**: Brew these teas following package instructions, usually steeping for 5-10 minutes. Drink a warm cup in the evening or during particularly anxious moments.

For maximum benefits, sip tea while practicing mindful breathing or reading a calming book. Integrating these teas into a soothing bedtime routine can help create a more relaxed state.
