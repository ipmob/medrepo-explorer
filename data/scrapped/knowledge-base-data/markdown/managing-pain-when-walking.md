## Ankle Pain When Flexing the Foot Up

[Ankle pain](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/ankle-pain-without-injury-swelling) when flexing the foot upward is a common issue that affects individuals of various ages and lifestyles. This type of discomfort can be due to everyday activities or specific injuries.

The primary causes of [ankle pain](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/types-of-ankle-pain) during foot flexion include acute **injuries** like sprains or fractures, chronic conditions such as **arthritis**, or overuse injuries resulting from **repetitive motion**.

According to the [BJSM](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/35/2/103), ankle injuries are a significant concern in basketball, with a reported injury rate of **3.85 per 1000** participants. Strains on the muscles and tendons around the [ankle](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/easing-pain-when-walking) can also lead to pain.

Besides pain, symptoms might include **swelling**, **redness**, and **limited range of motion**. These signs can help determine the severity and type of injury, whether it's a mild sprain or something requiring more attention like a tendon rupture.

**Prevention Tips:**

Preventive measures include performing ankle-strengthening exercises, wearing supportive footwear, and making lifestyle adjustments to avoid activities that overly strain the ankle. Proper warm-up routines before exercise can also reduce the risk of injuries.

**When to See a Doctor:**

It's advisable to consult a healthcare provider if the pain persists despite rest and home care, if there is significant swelling, or if the ankle pain restricts normal walking and daily activities. Prompt medical evaluation is crucial to prevent further complications.

## Side Foot Pain When Walking

Side foot [pain](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/management-of-body-pain-when-walking) is a disruptive condition that can significantly affect one's ability to walk and perform daily activities. This type of pain may range from mild discomfort to severe agony.

Causes of side foot pain include mechanical issues like **flat feet** or **high [arches](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/foot-arch-cramps)**, **injuries** such as stress fractures, and health conditions like [plantar fasciitis](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/plantar-fasciitis-cant-walk) or **arthritis**. **Poorly fitted shoes** can also contribute to ongoing discomfort.

Additional symptoms that often accompany side foot pain include **swelling**, **bruising**, and **tenderness** along the affected side of the foot. These symptoms can help identify specific conditions like bursitis or tendonitis.

**Management Strategies:**

To manage side foot pain, consider using **over-the-counter pain relievers**, applying **ice packs** to reduce swelling, and wearing **orthotic inserts** to provide extra support. Regular **stretching** and **strengthening exercises** can also be beneficial.

## Talus Pain When Walking

Talus pain occurs in the **dome-shaped** bone that sits above the [heel](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/heel-pain-after-running) bone and below the **shin bones**, integral for ankle motion. Pain in this area can make walking difficult and is particularly problematic because of the talus bone's key role in weight distribution and movement.

Talus pain can result from **traumatic injuries** such as falls or car accidents, leading to fractures. It can also stem from **degenerative diseases** like arthritis or from avascular necrosis, where the bone loses its blood supply and dies.

**Management Tips:**

Managing talus pain includes **resting** and avoiding activities that exacerbate the pain. **Ice packs** and **compression** can help reduce swelling and discomfort. **Over-the-counter pain medication** may also be used to manage pain levels.

## Knee Pain When Going Up Stairs

Knee pain when ascending stairs is a common complaint, particularly among active individuals and older adults. This type of pain can significantly hinder mobility and reduce quality of life.

**Causes**

- **Patellar Tendinitis**: Inflammation of the tendon connecting the kneecap to the shinbone.
- **Arthritis**: Degenerative changes in the knee joint, particularly osteoarthritis.
- **Chondromalacia Patella**: Softening and deterioration of the cartilage under the kneecap.

Accompanying symptoms might include a clicking or grinding sound, stiffness in the knee after sitting for long periods, and swelling around the kneecap. Such symptoms often indicate the severity of the underlying condition affecting the knee.

## Knee Pain When Going Down Stairs

Knee pain when descending stairs is often more pronounced than when going up due to the increased force exerted on the knee joint. This condition is particularly challenging as it can limit one’s ability to navigate steps safely.

**Causes**

- **Knee Ligament Injuries**: Damage to the ligaments in the knee, such as the ACL or MCL.
- **Meniscal Tears**: Tearing of the meniscus, a piece of cartilage that acts as a cushion between your thighbone and shinbone.
- **Knee Arthritis**: Progression of degenerative changes in the knee joint, exacerbating pain with pressure activities like descending stairs.

Symptoms accompanying knee pain during this activity often include a sharp, **stabbing pain** in the front of the knee, swelling, and a sensation of the knee "giving out." These signs can help in identifying specific knee problems, such as patellar tracking issues.

**Management Tips:**

Managing this type of knee pain involves using techniques to reduce strain on the knees, such as leading with the stronger leg when stepping down and using handrails whenever possible. **Exercises** that increase knee stability and flexibility can also be beneficial.
