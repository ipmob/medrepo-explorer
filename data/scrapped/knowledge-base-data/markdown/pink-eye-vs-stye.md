## What is Stye vs Pink Eye?

A stye is a red, painful lump near the **edge of the eyelid**, caused by a **bacterial infection**. It often resembles a pimple and can form on the inside or outside of the eyelid. A stye typically goes away on its own within a week.

[Pink eye](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/conditions-misdiagnosed-as-pink-eye), or **conjunctivitis**, is an inflammation or infection of the conjunctiva, the transparent membrane covering the white part of the eyeball. It can be caused by bacteria, viruses, allergens, or irritants.

According to the [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10057170/) publication, viral conjunctivitis accounts for **65-90%** of acute conjunctivitis cases. Pink eye results in redness, itching, and discharge from the eye.

The main difference between a stye and pink eye is their **location** and **cause**. A stye affects the **eyelid**, while pink eye affects the **conjunctiva**.

Both conditions require proper care to avoid complications.

## Stye Symptoms vs Pink Eye Symptoms

**Stye Symptoms**:

- Painful red bump on the eyelid
- Swelling and tenderness
- Pus production
- Watery eyes

**Pink Eye Symptoms**:

- Redness in the white of the eye
- Itching
- Gritty feeling
- Discharge that can form a crust overnight (clear, white, yellow, or green)

To differentiate, observe the location and type of discomfort. Styes are more localized to the eyelid and are usually painful, while pink eye affects the whole eye and is often itchy and red.

## Pink Eye vs Stye: Treatment

**Stye Treatment**:

- Apply warm compresses: Apply a warm, moist cloth to the affected area several times a day to reduce swelling and promote drainage.
- Maintain eyelid hygiene: Keep the eyelid clean by gently washing it with mild soap and water.
- Avoid eye makeup: Refrain from using eye makeup until the stye heals to prevent further irritation.
- Avoid squeezing: Do not squeeze or try to pop the stye, as this can spread the infection.

Most styes resolve without medical intervention within one to two weeks.

**Pink Eye Treatment**:

- Bacterial conjunctivitis: This may require medical attention. Follow your healthcare provider's recommendations for treatment.
- Viral conjunctivitis: Usually resolves on its own. Symptoms can be managed with proper care.
- Allergic conjunctivitis: Identify and avoid the allergen. Over-the-counter remedies may help alleviate symptoms.
- Keep the eyes clean: Gently clean the eyes with a damp cloth to remove discharge.
- Avoid contact lenses: Do not wear contact lenses until the infection has cleared.

Preventing both conditions involves good hygiene practices, such as washing hands frequently and avoiding touching the eyes.

Regular cleaning of contact lenses and makeup tools also helps reduce the risk.
