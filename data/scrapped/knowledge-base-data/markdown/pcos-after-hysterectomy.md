## Does PCOS go away after hysterectomy?

[Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/pcos-overview) is a hormonal disorder common among women of reproductive age. According to the [AMA](https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/population-care/what-doctors-wish-patients-knew-about-polycystic-ovary-syndrome), PCOS affects **6-12% of women of reproductive age** in the United States​

It is characterized by [irregular menstrual periods](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/8-types-of-abnormal-menstruation), excess androgen levels, and polycystic ovaries. A hysterectomy involves the surgical removal of the uterus and, in some cases, the ovaries and fallopian tubes.

A hysterectomy is a common surgical procedure among women; **1 in 3 women** in the United States have a hysterectomy by **age 60** as per [ASA](https://www.asahq.org/madeforthismoment/preparing-for-surgery/procedures/hysterectomy/#:~:text=One%20in%20three%20women%20in,preparations%2C%20and%20postoperative%20pain%20management.). It can affect the ovaries and hormone production depending on whether the ovaries are removed.

**Removing the uterus itself does not eliminate PCOS** because the syndrome is primarily related to ovarian function and hormonal imbalance. Scientific findings suggest that PCOS can persist after a hysterectomy if the ovaries are not removed.

Medical opinions indicate that while some symptoms may lessen, others can continue, requiring ongoing management.

## Can you have PCOS after a hysterectomy?

Yes, it is possible to have Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) after a hysterectomy, but it depends on the type of hysterectomy performed. Here’s a more detailed explanation:

**Types of Hysterectomy**

1. **Total Hysterectomy**: Removal of the uterus and cervix.
2. **Subtotal (Partial) Hysterectomy**: Removal of the uterus, leaving the cervix in place.
3. **Total Hysterectomy with Bilateral Salpingo-Oophorectomy**: Removal of the uterus, cervix, both ovaries, and fallopian tubes.

**Impact on PCOS**

- **Ovaries Retained**: If the ovaries are retained (as in a total or subtotal hysterectomy without removal of the ovaries), the person can still have PCOS. This is because PCOS is primarily a condition involving the ovaries, where they produce an excess of androgens (male hormones) and may have cysts.
- **Ovaries Removed**: If the ovaries are removed (as in a total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy), the person cannot have PCOS anymore, since the condition directly involves the ovaries. However, they might experience symptoms related to hormonal imbalances or other conditions that mimic PCOS symptoms.

## What are the symptoms of PCOS after partial hysterectomy?

A partial hysterectomy involves the removal of the uterus while leaving one or both ovaries intact. This means that hormone production continues, which can sustain PCOS symptoms. Typical PCOS symptoms include:

- irregular menstrual cycles
- excessive hair growth
- [acne](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/pcos-acne)
- weight gain.

After a partial hysterectomy, these symptoms may persist because the **hormonal imbalance associated with PCOS remains**. However, the absence of the uterus means that **menstrual irregularities might present differently**. For instance, without a uterus, you won't have menstrual periods, but the underlying hormonal issues can still cause other symptoms like acne, [weight gain](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/weight-gain-after-hysterectomy) and excess hair growth.

## How to treat PCOS after hysterectomy?

Treatment goals for managing PCOS post-hysterectomy focus on controlling symptoms and maintaining hormonal balance. Here are some key strategies:

**Lifestyle Changes:**

- Follow a balanced diet rich in whole foods and low in processed sugars to help manage weight and improve insulin sensitivity.
- Engage in regular physical activity, including both cardio and strength training exercises.

**Medical Treatments:**

- Hormone therapy to balance androgen levels (consult a healthcare provider for specific recommendations).
- Regular medical check-ups to monitor hormone levels and adjust treatments as necessary.

**Alternative Therapies and Supplements:**

- Consider [supplements](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/pcos-supplements) such as vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids to support overall health.
- Explore alternative therapies like acupuncture or herbal remedies under the guidance of a healthcare provider.
