## What Essential Oils Help with Nausea?

Essential oils are concentrated extracts from plants known for their therapeutic benefits, including helping with nausea.

- **Peppermint oil** is popular for nausea relief due to its soothing properties.
- **Ginger oil** is another effective option, often used for digestive issues. According to the NCBI [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4818021/), the best available evidence demonstrates that ginger is an effective and inexpensive treatment for nausea and vomiting and is safe.
- **Lavender oil**, known for its calming effects, can also help reduce nausea symptoms.

To use these essential oils, you can inhale them **directly from the bottle** or **add a few drops to a diffuser**.

Another method is to mix a few drops with a carrier oil and apply it to your wrists or temples.

Always consult with a healthcare professional before using essential oils, especially if you are pregnant or have underlying health conditions.

## What Teas Help with Nausea?

Teas have been used for centuries for their soothing properties and can be particularly effective in alleviating nausea.

- **Ginger tea** is well-known for its ability to ease nausea.
- **Peppermint tea** can also help calm the stomach and reduce nausea.
- **Chamomile tea** is another good option, known for its relaxing effects which can help reduce nausea symptoms.

To prepare these teas, steep the tea bag or fresh ingredients in hot water for about **5-10 minutes**. Drinking the tea slowly and at a comfortable temperature can maximize its soothing effects.

Drinking certain teas can help alleviate nausea naturally. Experiment with different types to see which one works best for you, and consult a healthcare professional if needed.

## What Foods Help with Pregnancy Nausea?

[Pregnancy nausea](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/managing-nausea-in-the-third-trimester), often called morning sickness, is common and can occur at any time of the day. Finding foods that help can provide relief:

- **Crackers** are a popular choice as they are easy to digest and can help settle the stomach. Keep crackers by your bed to eat before getting up in the morning.
- **Bananas** are another great option, offering potassium and being gentle on the stomach. Incorporate bananas into smoothies or eat them as a snack.
- **Ginger**, whether in the form of ginger snaps or ginger ale, is known for its anti-nausea properties. Try ginger in various forms to see which is most effective for you.
- **Applesauce** can be soothing and easy to eat, providing a gentle source of nutrition. Applesauce can be eaten on its own or added to other foods.

## What Foods Help with Nausea from Chemo?

Chemotherapy can cause significant nausea, making it challenging to maintain proper nutrition. Certain foods can help alleviate these symptoms:

- **Plain toast** or **rice** are bland and easy to digest, which can help calm the stomach. Toast and rice can be consumed alone or with a small amount of butter.
- **Oatmeal** is gentle on the stomach and provides necessary nutrients. Oatmeal can be eaten plain or with a bit of honey.
- **Clear broths** can offer hydration and are easy to consume. Sip clear broths slowly to stay hydrated.
- **Apples** and **applesauce** can provide relief without being too harsh on the stomach. Incorporate apples into your diet by eating them fresh or as applesauce.
- **Ginger**, in any form, is well-known for its nausea-reducing properties. Experiment with ginger in teas or snacks.

Eat small, frequent meals to keep your stomach settled.
