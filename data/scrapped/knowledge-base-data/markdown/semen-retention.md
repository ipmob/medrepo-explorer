## What is semen retention?

Semen retention is the practice of **deliberately avoiding ejaculation**. This practice can be part of various spiritual or health routines. Some people believe it helps increase energy levels and mental clarity.

[Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9676765/) in 2022 found that even though semen retention was the top men’s health topic on social media, most information shared was **inaccurate** and **not from medical professionals**.

Semen retention has historical roots in several cultures and traditions. Practitioners claim benefits for physical, mental, and spiritual health. The idea is to conserve sexual energy for other uses.

## Does semen retention increase testosterone?

There is limited scientific evidence to support the claim that semen retention increases testosterone.

Some [studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12659241/) suggest a temporary rise in testosterone levels after a few days of abstinence. However, the long-term effects on testosterone levels are **unclear** and **need more research**. There is no strong evidence to support the bold claims of improved physical and mental health.

Those studies suggesting a rise in testosterone due to semen retention are old (from the early 2000s) and have small sample sizes. Dr. Justin Dubin, a men's health specialist and urologist at Memorial Healthcare System, [states](https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/reproductive-health/semen-retention) that _these studies are insufficient evidence and does not recommend semen retention for anyone_.

Most medical experts agree that regular ejaculation has no adverse effects on testosterone. Claims about significant testosterone boosts from semen retention remain anecdotal.

## What are the benefits of semen retention?

Advocates of semen retention claim various benefits, though scientific evidence is limited. Some reported benefits include:

- Increased energy levels
- Improved mental clarity
- Enhanced focus and productivity
- Boosted confidence and self-control
- Deeper sense of connection and mindfulness
- Improved overall mood
- Greater emotional stability

Despite these anecdotal reports, more research is needed to confirm these benefits scientifically. It is important to mention a [2018 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30570220/#:~:text=Conclusions%3A%20Ejaculatory%20abstinence%20periods%20of,4%20days%20of%20ejaculatory%20abstinence.) that found periods of ejaculatory abstinence **longer than four days can negatively affect sperm DNA** and certain fertility treatments.

In contrast, one day of abstinence significantly improved implantation rates and tended to increase pregnancy rates compared to two, three, and four days of abstinence.

## Does semen retention promote hair growth?

There is no substantial scientific evidence to suggest that semen retention directly promotes hair growth. Hair growth is primarily influenced by **genetics**, **hormones**, and **overall health**.

While some people claim that semen retention improves their hair quality, these claims are mostly anecdotal. Healthy hair is more likely related to a **balanced diet**, **proper hair care**, and **good health practices**.

Hormonal balance can affect hair health, but semen retention's role in this is not well-supported by research.

Additionally, some supplements are marketed to support hair growth by providing essential vitamins and minerals, but their effectiveness can vary. For reliable advice on hair growth, it is best to consult a healthcare professional.

## What is the semen retention timeline?

The timeline for semen retention varies among practitioners and depends on individual goals. Some men practice short-term retention, abstaining for a few days to a week. Others engage in long-term retention, lasting several weeks or even months.

The perceived benefits may appear at different stages for different individuals. Early stages might include increased **energy** and **focus**, while long-term practice could enhance **self-control** and **mental clarity**.

It is important to approach semen retention with realistic expectations and consult a healthcare provider if needed. The timeline is flexible and should be adjusted to fit personal health and lifestyle.
