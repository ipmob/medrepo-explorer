## Lower Back Pain When Standing Too Long

Prolonged standing often leads to lower back pain by exerting continuous pressure on the spine and surrounding muscles.

**Causes**:

- Poor posture which misaligns the spine.
- Inadequate footwear that fails to provide necessary support.
- Weak core muscles which are crucial for spinal support.

**Prevention Tips**:

- Maintain an upright posture with shoulders back and belly tucked in.
- Use a footrest to alternate weight between feet.
- Wear supportive shoes to cushion and properly align the spine.
- Incorporate core strengthening exercises to enhance spinal support.

## Severe Lower Back Pain When Walking or Standing

Experiencing severe pain in the [lower back while walking](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/lower-back-pain-when-walking-treatment-and-prevention-tips) or standing can indicate significant spinal health issues.

**Causes**:

- Herniated discs causing nerve pressure.
- Spinal stenosis which narrows the spinal canal.
- Degenerative disc disease that deteriorates spinal discs.

**Management Strategies**:

- Engage in physical therapy to improve mobility and reduce pain.
- Adjust your daily ergonomics to support spinal health.
- Consider medication to manage pain, under a doctor’s guidance.
- Consult healthcare providers for advanced treatments like injections or surgical options if pain continues.

- Severe neck stiffness
- Symptoms that radiate beyond the back

Such symptoms require urgent care to prevent further complications.

## How Long Should I Wear a Back Brace for Lower Back Pain?

Back braces are supportive devices that help stabilize the lower back, reduce pain, and prevent further injury during recovery.

**Recommendations for Use**:

- Duration: It is generally advised to wear a back brace for brief periods, specifically a few hours each day, particularly during activities known to strain the back. This helps in minimizing discomfort while ensuring the back is not overly reliant on the brace, which can weaken muscles over time.
- Effectiveness: Best used when engaging in activities that might exacerbate pain, such as lifting heavy objects or prolonged standing.

**Important Considerations**:

- Overuse Risks: Prolonged use can lead to muscle dependency and weaken the back muscles.
- Lifestyle Integration: Use the brace as part of a comprehensive back care strategy, including exercise and proper ergonomics.
- Supportive Measures: Combine the use of a back brace with physical therapy, proper posture, and core strengthening exercises to maximize healing.

## What Will Urgent Care Do for Lower Back Pain?

Urgent care centers provide immediate medical attention for acute lower back pain, offering a faster alternative to emergency room visits.

**Initial Assessment**:

- A thorough physical examination to assess pain severity and mobility.
- Possible imaging tests such as X-rays or MRIs to diagnose underlying causes.

**Treatment Options**:

- Medications: Administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or muscle relaxants to alleviate pain.
- Physical Therapies: Short-term relief techniques may be demonstrated.
- Referrals: If necessary, referrals to specialists like orthopedists or physical therapists are provided.
- Follow-up Care: Urgent care will advise on whether a follow-up with a primary care physician or specialist is necessary.
