## What is Cloudy Vision?

Cloudy vision is when your eyesight becomes less clear, making things look [blurry](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/solving-blurry-vision-in-one-eye-causes-and-solutions) or hazy. It is often described as looking through a **foggy window**.

This condition can affect one or both eyes and can be constant or intermittent.

Cloudy vision is different from other vision problems like nearsightedness or farsightedness, as it usually indicates an issue with the eye's clarity.

## What Causes Cloudy Vision?

Several factors can cause cloudy vision, including:

- [**Cataracts**](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/glaucoma-vs-cataracts): Cloudy areas in the lens of the eye, often due to aging, trauma, or other eye conditions. These prevent light from passing clearly through the lens, leading to blurred vision.
- **Glaucoma**: A condition that damages the optic nerve, often due to high pressure in the eye. It can lead to both cloudy vision and loss of peripheral vision if untreated. According to the [AAO](https://www.aao.org/newsroom/eye-health-statistics), glaucoma affects about 3 million Americans.
- **Eye Infections**: Infections such as conjunctivitis or keratitis can cause inflammation and cloudiness in the vision.
- **Inflammation**: Conditions like uveitis, which is inflammation of the uvea, can lead to cloudy vision.
- **Corneal Swelling**: Edema or swelling of the cornea can cause the eye to become hazy or blurry.
- **Diabetes**: Fluctuating blood sugar levels can affect the clarity of vision, leading to temporary or persistent cloudiness.
- **Aging**: As people age, the eye’s lens can become less clear, resulting in cloudy vision.

## Cloudy Vision in One Eye

Cloudy vision in one eye can be particularly concerning. This can be caused by a **cataract forming in that eye**, or it may indicate an issue like an **eye infection** or **corneal abrasion**.

In some cases, it could be a sign of a more serious condition, such as **optic neuritis** or a **detached retina**.

If you experience cloudy vision in one eye, it's important to seek medical advice promptly to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.

## Cloudy Vision That Comes and Goes

Intermittent cloudy vision can be frustrating. This type of vision problem may be caused by [**dry eye syndrome**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/tips-for-dry-eyes-at-night), where the eyes don't produce enough tears or the tears evaporate too quickly.

It can also be due to [**migraines**](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/heat-or-cold-for-migraine), which can cause temporary visual disturbances.

**Fluctuating blood sugar levels**, especially in diabetics, can also lead to cloudy vision that comes and goes.

Keeping a record of when the cloudy vision occurs can help in diagnosing the underlying cause.

## Treatment for Cloudy Vision After Cataract Surgery

Cloudy vision after cataract surgery is often due to a condition called **posterior capsule opacification** (PCO). This occurs when the back of the lens capsule, which holds the artificial lens in place, becomes cloudy.

Treatment typically involves a simple laser procedure called **YAG laser capsulotomy**, which clears the cloudiness.

If the cloudy vision is due to inflammation or infection post-surgery, specific **eye drops** or other medications can effectively reduce these symptoms and clear up vision.

It is also important to follow all post-surgery care instructions to minimize the risk of complications and ensure the best possible outcome for your vision.
