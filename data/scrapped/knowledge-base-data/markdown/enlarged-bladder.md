## What is an enlarged bladder?

An enlarged bladder is a condition where the **bladder is larger than normal**, often due to excess urine retention.

In a normal bladder, urine is stored temporarily before being expelled. The urinary bladder can store up to **500** ml of urine in women and **700** ml in men, as per the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care [(IQWiG)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279384/#:~:text=The%20urinary%20bladder%20can%20store,ml%20of%20urine%20in%20it.).

An enlarged bladder may store more urine than usual, leading to discomfort or other urinary issues. This enlargement can result from various underlying conditions that disrupt normal bladder function.

The condition can be mistaken with a [distended bladder](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/distended-bladder). A distended bladder refers to temporary stretching due to being overly full, while an enlarged bladder indicates a more permanent increase in size often caused by chronic conditions.

Understanding what an enlarged bladder is important because it can lead to complications, such as urinary tract infections or kidney damage if left untreated. Early recognition helps in managing symptoms effectively.

## What causes an enlarged bladder?

Several factors can lead to an enlarged bladder, each impacting the bladder's ability to function properly.

One common cause is **bladder outlet obstruction**, where the flow of urine is blocked, leading to urine retention. Other causes include neurological disorders that affect bladder control, or chronic [urinary tract infections](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/bladder-infection-vs-uti) that lead to inflammation and enlargement. Conditions like Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and spinal cord injuries can contribute to bladder dysfunction, including enlargement, due to nerve damage that affects bladder control, notes [StatPearls](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560617/).

Risk factors include age, as older adults are more prone to bladder issues, and conditions like [diabetes](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/diabetes) or spinal cord injuries. Lifestyle factors, such as a sedentary lifestyle or poor hydration, can also contribute to the risk of developing an enlarged bladder.

## Enlarged bladder symptoms

Recognizing the symptoms of an enlarged bladder is crucial for early diagnosis and effective management.

**Common Symptoms**:

- Difficulty starting urination
- Weak urine stream
- Feeling of incomplete bladder emptying
- Frequent urination, especially at night
- Urgent need to urinate
- Discomfort or pain in the lower abdomen

If the condition worsens, symptoms can include urinary incontinence or the inability to urinate, which requires immediate medical attention.

## Is an enlarged bladder dangerous?

An enlarged bladder can pose significant health risks if left untreated, making it important to address this condition promptly.

**Potential Complications**:

- **Chronic Urinary Retention**: Persistent inability to fully empty the bladder can lead to severe kidney damage.
- **Recurrent** [**Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)**](https://docus.ai/tags/uti): An enlarged bladder increases the risk of UTIs due to stagnant urine.
- **Bladder Stones**: Retained urine can form crystals that develop into bladder stones, causing pain and infections.
- **Bladder Rupture**: In rare cases, a severely enlarged bladder can rupture, leading to a medical emergency.

It’s important to seek medical attention if you experience any symptoms of an enlarged bladder. Early treatment can prevent these serious complications and improve quality of life.

## Treatment for an enlarged bladder

Treating an enlarged bladder focuses on addressing the underlying cause and managing symptoms to improve quality of life.

**Lifestyle Changes**:

- **Hydration**: Adjusting fluid intake to prevent overfilling the bladder.
- **Timed Voiding**: Establishing a regular schedule for urination to avoid excessive bladder stretching.
- [**Diet**](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/bladder-cleansing-foods): Managing your diet by reducing the intake of bladder irritants, such as caffeine and alcohol, can help alleviate symptoms and prevent further bladder enlargement.

**Medical Interventions**:

- **Bladder Training**: Techniques to improve bladder control and reduce symptoms of urgency and frequency.
- **Pelvic Floor Exercises**: Strengthening the muscles that support bladder function, often recommended for improving bladder control.

**Advanced Treatments**:

- **Surgical Options**: In some cases, surgery may be required to remove blockages or correct structural issues.
- **Catheterization**: In cases of severe retention, catheterization may be necessary to drain the bladder regularly.

Regular follow-ups with a healthcare provider are crucial to ensure that treatment is effective and to adjust the approach as needed.
