## Does Menopause Cause Itching?

Yes, [menopause](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/about-menopause) can cause itching due to hormonal changes. This condition, known as " **pruritus**," occurs because **reduced [estrogen levels](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/estrogen)** affect the skin.

Lower estrogen leads to **decreased collagen formation** and **moisture retention**, resulting in dry, itchy skin.

## What Causes the Scalp to Itch During Menopause?

The scalp may experience increased itchiness during menopause due to a combination of factors:

- **Hormonal Imbalances**: Medical News Today [highlights](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322587#_noHeaderPrefixedContent) that hormonal changes, especially reduced estrogen levels, are the main culprits. This imbalance can affect the production of oils, leading to dryness and irritation.
- **Dehydration**: Menopause can lead to overall dehydration, affecting skin hydration. Since the scalp's skin is just like the rest of the body's skin, it can become dry and itchy when not adequately hydrated.
- **Skin Conditions**: Conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, or seborrheic dermatitis may become more pronounced during menopause. The hormonal changes can exacerbate these conditions, leading to increased scalp itching.
- **Decreased Oil Production**: The scalp's oil glands may produce less sebum, the natural oil that helps keep the scalp moisturized. Reduced sebum production can result in a drier scalp, which is prone to itching.
- **Sensitivity to Hair Care Products**: Menopausal changes can also make the scalp more sensitive to hair care products. Products that were previously well-tolerated may now cause irritation or allergic reactions, contributing to itchiness.

## How to Treat Menopause Itching at Night?

Menopause-related itching can become more pronounced at night, disturbing sleep and reducing overall comfort. This heightened sensation of itchiness during the night can be due to the body's temperature regulation changes and the lack of distractions that daytime activities provide.

**Lifestyle Modifications**:

- Use hypoallergenic bedding to reduce skin irritation.
- Keep the bedroom cool and well-ventilated to prevent sweating, which can exacerbate itching.
- Wear loose, breathable clothing to bed to reduce skin irritation.

**Skincare Routine Adjustments**:

- Implement a gentle, moisturizing routine using products formulated for sensitive or dry skin to nourish the skin before sleep.
- Consider using an over-the-counter anti-itch cream or lotion specifically designed for nighttime use.
- Avoid hot showers or baths before bed, as they can strip the skin of natural oils, worsening dryness and itching.

**Dietary Considerations**:

- Stay hydrated throughout the day to help maintain skin moisture.
- Incorporate foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, like salmon or flaxseeds, which can support skin health and reduce inflammation.

**Medical Treatments**:

- For severe cases, consult with a healthcare provider about the possibility of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or prescription creams that can alleviate symptoms.
- Topical treatments such as steroid creams may be recommended for localized itching.

## Does Menopause Itching Go Away?

The itching caused by menopause **can eventually go away** as the body adjusts to new hormone levels.

This process varies; for some, symptoms diminish within months, while others may experience itching longer.

Maintaining a good skincare routine, staying hydrated, and living a healthy lifestyle can help alleviate symptoms.

If itching persists, consult a healthcare provider for treatments like hormone replacement therapy or topical creams. Identifying and managing underlying skin conditions can also reduce itching.

Overall, menopausal itching is often temporary and improves with proper care and treatment.
