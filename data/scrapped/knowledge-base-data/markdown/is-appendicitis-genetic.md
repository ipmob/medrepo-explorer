Appendicitis occurs when the appendix becomes swollen and inflamed. It is not fully genetic, but family history can increase your risk.

**Genetics** refers to how certain genes can raise the likelihood of developing a condition, while **hereditary** means traits are directly passed down from parents to children.

Diet, lifestyle, and infections also play a major role in the chances of developing appendicitis.

## Is appendicitis genetic?

Appendicitis is not a genetic condition, meaning it doesn’t come directly from a single gene mutation. However, your **genes can affect your chances** of getting it.

Recent [findings](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/2782356) suggest that one gene, [**NEDD4L**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEDD4L), could be linked to a higher risk of appendicitis. This gene controls certain processes in the body. It affects how the appendix handles [sodium](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/sodium) and water.

Changes (variations) in this gene might cause problems in the appendix. These problems, such as **blockages or swelling**, can lead to appendicitis.

This doesn’t mean everyone with a variation in this gene will get appendicitis. It simply makes them more likely to develop it if other factors, like infections or blockages, occur.

Although genetics plays a role, appendicitis usually results from a mix of genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors.

## Is appendicitis hereditary?

Appendicitis is not a **hereditary disease** in the traditional sense. However, a **familial tendency** has been observed, according to a [study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/145749690709600405). If your parent or sibling had appendicitis, your chances of developing it are slightly higher.

This doesn’t mean it’s passed down directly like some genetic conditions. Instead, it may be due to:

- **Shared genetic factors** that increase risk.
- **Common environmental influences**, such as diet or exposure to infections.

Most cases of appendicitis happen **randomly**, without any clear genetic inheritance. However, knowing your family history can help you stay alert to the symptoms.

## What are the other risk factors for appendicitis?

Several factors aside from genetics can increase the risk of developing appendicitis:

- **Age:** Appendicitis most commonly affects people between the ages of 10 and 30, although it can occur at any age.
- **Gender:** Males are slightly more likely to develop appendicitis than females.
- **Obstruction of the Appendix:** Blockages caused by hardened stool (fecaliths), enlarged lymphoid follicles, parasites, or foreign bodies can lead to inflammation.
- **Infections:** Gastrointestinal infections or systemic viral infections can cause swelling of lymph nodes in the intestinal wall, which may block the appendix.
- [**Diet**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/what-food-can-cause-appendicitis) **:** A diet low in fiber and high in refined carbohydrates may contribute to constipation and fecalith formation, potentially increasing the risk.
- **Lifestyle Factors:** Sedentary habits may affect digestive health, although a direct link to appendicitis is not well-established.
- **Environmental Factors:** Geographic location and seasons may affect appendicitis rates. Some studies find higher cases at certain times of the year, possibly due to infections.
