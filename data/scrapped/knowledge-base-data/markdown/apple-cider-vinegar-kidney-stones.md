## Is apple cider vinegar good for kidney stones?

Apple cider vinegar is often considered beneficial for kidney stones due to its **natural acidic properties**. The acetic acid in apple cider vinegar can help dissolve kidney stones or prevent their formation. By breaking down the stones, it can potentially make them easier to [pass through the urinary tract](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/stages-of-passing-kidney-stone).

A study from [eBioMedicine](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(19)30379-2/fulltext) found that vinegar can prevent kidney stones by affecting how the body excretes **citrate** and **calcium**. This regulation helps prevent stones from forming or recurring.

Additionally, a 2017 [study](https://bjui-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bju.13828) in China found that fermented vinegar positively impacts kidney stone prevention and is significantly associated with a reduced risk of stone formation.

Moreover, apple cider vinegar is known to enhance the body's alkalinity despite its acidic nature. This can help create an environment in the kidneys that is less conducive to stone formation.

Therefore, many people believe that apple cider vinegar can be a supportive natural remedy for kidney stones when used correctly.

## What are the benefits of apple cider vinegar for kidney stones?

Apple cider vinegar offers several benefits for those dealing with kidney stones:

- **Dissolves Kidney Stones**: The acetic acid in apple cider vinegar can help break down kidney stones, making them smaller and easier to pass through the urinary system.
- **Prevents New Stones**: Apple cider vinegar helps to alkalize the blood and urine, creating an environment in which kidney stones are less likely to form.
- **Detoxifying Properties**: Its natural detoxifying properties help to flush out toxins and other minerals that can contribute to stone formation.
- **Reduces Pain and Inflammation**: Apple cider vinegar's anti-inflammatory properties can soothe the urinary tract, providing relief during the passing of stones.

Overall, these benefits make apple cider vinegar a popular natural remedy for managing and preventing kidney stones.

## How much apple cider vinegar for kidney stones?

According to [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/health/kidney-health/home-remedies-for-kidney-stones#apple-cider-vinegar), the recommended amount of apple cider vinegar for kidney stones is typically about **1 to 2 tablespoons per day**. It is best to dilute the vinegar in **6 to 8 ounces of drinking water** to make it easier to consume and gentler on the stomach.

For best results, it is generally recommended to drink the apple cider vinegar mixture **twice a day**. It's advisable **not to consume more than one 8-ounce glass of this mixture per day**.

Another way to incorporate apple cider vinegar is by sprinkling it onto salads or adding it to a favorite salad dressing.

It's important to start with a smaller amount, such as 1 teaspoon, to see how the body reacts. Gradually increase the dosage to the recommended 1 to 2 tablespoons. This gradual increase helps prevent any potential digestive discomfort and allows the body to adjust to the acidity of the vinegar.
