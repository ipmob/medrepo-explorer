## What is TMJ Headache?

A TMJ headache is a type of pain associated with **temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders**. This joint connects your jawbone to your skull. According to the American Academy of Family Physicians ( [AAFP](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2023/0100/temporomandibular-disorders.html#:~:text=Temporomandibular%20disorders%20affect%20between%205,hearing%2C%20and%20hyperacuity%20to%20sound.)), temporomandibular disorders affect between **5%** and **12%** of the population.

Common causes include **jaw misalignment**, **[teeth grinding](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/baby-teeth-grinding)** (bruxism), **arthritis** in the TMJ, and **excessive gum chewing**.

**Stress** and **poor posture** can also exacerbate TMJ symptoms.

TMJ headaches can severely impact daily activities due to the pain and discomfort in the jaw and surrounding areas. They may affect eating, talking, and even sleeping patterns, influencing overall quality of life.

## What Does a TMJ Headache Feel Like?

The primary symptoms include aching **pain in and around the ear**, **tenderness of the jaw**, **pain while chewing**, and a **clicking or locking jaw**.

Headaches typically manifest as a **dull**, **aching pain** in the temples.

Individuals often describe the pain as a tight, vice-like tension around the forehead or temples. This discomfort might be accompanied by facial pain and soreness.

These headaches can last from a **few hours to several days**, varying in intensity. The pain might worsen with jaw movement and can range from mild to debilitating.

## TMJ Headache Location

- **General Area**: TMJ headaches typically manifest around the temporomandibular joint, which is located just in front of the ears. The pain often radiates to the temples, making it feel like a tension headache.
- **Specific Regions**: The pain can also spread to the lower jaw, ears, neck, and even the shoulders. This can lead to a widespread area of discomfort, not just confined to the jaw or temple.
- **Associated Discomfort**: In addition to the primary headache locations, individuals may experience related discomfort in the face, especially around the cheeks and under the eyes. This pain is often exacerbated by jaw movements such as chewing or speaking.

## Is TMJ Headache Dangerous?

TMJ headaches themselves are **not typically dangerous**, but they can significantly affect the quality of life. The pain and discomfort can hinder daily activities and lead to increased stress and anxiety.

Chronic TMJ disorders can lead to worsening pain and potentially permanent damage to the jaw joint and muscles if left untreated. It may also contribute to long-term habits of poor posture and abnormal jaw alignment.

It's important to consult a healthcare professional if TMJ headaches become frequent, severely impact your daily life, or are accompanied by increased jaw dysfunction, such as difficulty opening or closing the mouth. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent further complications.

## TMJ Headache Relief

TMJ headaches can be debilitating, but fortunately, there are multiple [strategies](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/combatting-tmj-headache) to manage and alleviate the pain.

**Non-Medical Interventions**:

- Maintain good posture to reduce strain on the TMJ.
- Apply warm or cold compresses to the jaw area to ease pain.
- Practice stress reduction techniques such as mindfulness and yoga.

**Physical Therapy**:

- Manual therapy to improve jaw movement and relieve pain.
- Exercises to strengthen and relax the jaw muscles.
- Guidance on better alignment and function of the jaw.

**Professional Treatments**:

- Oral splints or guards to minimize teeth clenching and grinding.
- Consultation with a dentist or TMJ specialist for customized care.

**Preventative Measures**:

- Eat soft foods and cut food into small pieces.
- Avoid extreme jaw movements like wide yawning and loud singing.
- Regularly perform jaw exercises to maintain mobility and reduce stiffness.

## When to See a Professional?

- Persistent pain or worsening symptoms despite home treatment.
- Occurrence of jaw locking or significant decrease in jaw function.
- Inability to manage the pain or discomfort with at-home remedies.
