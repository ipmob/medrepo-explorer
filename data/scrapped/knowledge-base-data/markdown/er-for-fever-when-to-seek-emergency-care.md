Understanding when to seek emergency room (ER) care for a fever is crucial, especially when dealing with severe symptoms or high temperatures that do not respond to standard treatments. Both adults and children may need ER attention under specific conditions, such as accompanying symptoms that indicate potentially serious health issues.

The ER offers specialized diagnostic tools and treatments aimed at quickly reducing fever and addressing its underlying causes, ensuring effective and efficient medical care.

## When to Go to the ER for Fever?

Deciding when to visit the emergency room (ER) for a [fever](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/when-to-go-to-the-hospital-for-fever) requires evaluating several factors, such as the fever's intensity, accompanying symptoms, and the individual's general health.

According to the CDC [publication](https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/healthcare-us/ppe/guidance.html), fevers are a common reason for ER visits. Adults should consider ER care if their fever reaches **103°F (39.4°C)** or higher and doesn't decrease with over-the-counter medications.

Moreover, if the fever includes severe symptoms like **difficulty breathing**, **chest pain**, **intense headaches**, **confusion**, continuous **vomiting**, or **dehydration** signs, immediate medical attention is necessary.

People with weakened immune systems, such as those on chemotherapy, affected by HIV/AIDS, or taking immunosuppressant drugs, should be particularly vigilant. Even a slight fever might indicate a severe infection for them, necessitating prompt ER attention.

The ER provides critical resources for severe and potentially life-threatening conditions, including immediate diagnostic tests and treatments not available in less urgent medical settings. If there's uncertainty—especially with serious symptoms or pre-existing health issues—it's always safer to err on the side of caution and opt for an ER visit.

## When to Take Your Child to the ER for Fever?

Deciding when to take a child to the emergency room (ER) for a [fever](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/newborn-baby-fever-essential-tips) involves several critical considerations, including the child's age, the severity of the fever, and accompanying symptoms.

For infants under three months old, an immediate ER visit is necessary if they have a rectal temperature of **100.4°F (38°C)** or higher, as such a fever at this age may indicate a serious infection.

For children aged **three months to three years**, ER care is advised if the fever exceeds **102.2°F (39°C)** and does not respond to fever-reducing medicines, or if it accompanies symptoms like **difficulty breathing**, **rash**, **dehydration** signs (such as difficulty hydrating), continuous **crying**, extreme **irritability**, **lethargy**, or an overall appearance of being severely unwell.

Furthermore, children of any age showing symptoms of serious conditions alongside fever—such as **seizures** (febrile convulsions), stiff neck, intense headaches, severe abdominal pain, repeated vomiting, or dehydration indicators like absence of tears when crying, dry mouth, or not urinating for several hours—should also be taken to the ER immediately.

The ER is equipped with specialized pediatric care and advanced diagnostic tools crucial for assessing and managing serious conditions linked to fever in children. Parents and guardians should trust their instincts—if a child seems notably unwell or there’s any uncertainty about their health, opting for ER treatment is the safest decision.

## How Does the ER Treat High Fever?

Upon arrival at the emergency room (ER) with a high fever, the medical team implements a structured approach to both alleviate the fever and uncover its cause. Initially, they conduct a comprehensive assessment that includes recording the patient’s temperature, medical history, and symptoms to gauge the fever's severity and associated risks.

Treatment for a high fever in the ER typically begins with **managing discomfort** and **reducing the fever** itself. Common strategies include administering antipyretics which help lower body temperature. In situations where the fever is especially high or the patient is in considerable discomfort, more direct cooling methods may be employed, such as applying cool cloths or ice packs.

Beyond symptom management, the ER team diligently works to **diagnose** the cause of the fever. This diagnostic process may involve a variety of **tests**, such as blood tests, urine tests, imaging studies, or lumbar punctures, tailored to the suspected underlying issue. The objective here is to pinpoint any infections, inflammations, or other conditions that could be causing the fever.

Once the **cause is identified**, the ER provides targeted treatments which could include antibiotics for bacterial infections, antivirals for viral infections, or other specific medications suited to the diagnosis. In more severe scenarios or if the patient is at risk of complications, hospital admission may be necessary for extended care.
