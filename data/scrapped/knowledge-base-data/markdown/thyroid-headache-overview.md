## What is a Thyroid Headache?

A thyroid headache is a type of headache that is either caused by or closely associated with [thyroid conditions](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/early-warning-signs-thyroid-problems). It is not a medical term commonly recognized independently but is often discussed in the context of symptoms affecting individuals with thyroid imbalances.

Connection to Thyroid Issues:

Thyroid headaches are commonly reported by those suffering from thyroid disorders such as **hyperthyroidism** (an overactive thyroid) or **hypothyroidism** (an underactive thyroid).

**According to the NIDDK data**:

- Approximately [1 out of 100](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/endocrine-diseases/hyperthyroidism#:~:text=makes%20thyroid%20hormones.-,How%20common%20is%20hyperthyroidism%3F,years%20and%20older%20have%20hyperthyroidism.) Americans aged 12 and older are affected by **hyperthyroidism**.
- Similarly, around [5 out of 100](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/endocrine-diseases/hypothyroidism#:~:text=makes%20thyroid%20hormones.-,How%20common%20is%20hypothyroidism%3F,or%20have%20few%20obvious%20symptoms.) Americans in the same age group suffer from **hypothyroidism**, though the majority of these cases are either mild or display minimal symptoms.

These headaches may result from hormonal imbalances caused by the thyroid's irregular function, which can affect the body's nervous system and pain sensitivity.

## What Does a Thyroid Headache Feel Like?

Individuals experiencing thyroid headaches often describe them as a **persistent throbbing or stabbing pain** that can occur on one or both sides of the head.

**Comparison to Common Headaches:**

Unlike typical tension headaches that usually present as a mild to moderate dull pain around the forehead, thyroid headaches can be more severe and debilitating. They may also persist longer and occur alongside other thyroid-related symptoms, making them distinctive in their manifestation and impact.

## Where is a Thyroid Headache Typically Located?

- **Common Locations**: Thyroid headaches typically manifest in the front of the head, around the temples, or at the back of the neck. These areas are the most common sites where individuals report feeling pain.
- **Pattern of Pain**: The pain typically starts in one of these areas and may remain localized or spread across the head, sometimes feeling as if it is encircling the entire head.

## What are the Symptoms of a Thyroid-Related Headache?

**Primary Symptoms:**

Thyroid-related headaches can vary in pain type, often described as sharp or throbbing. These headaches may persist for several hours or even longer, distinguishing them from more transient headaches.

**Associated Symptoms:**

- **General [fatigue](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/sudden-crashing-fatigue-in-females#causes-of-sudden-crashing-fatigue-in-females)**: Often exacerbates the discomfort from the headache.
- **[Blurred vision](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/solving-blurry-vision-in-one-eye-causes-and-solutions)**: This symptom can interfere with daily activities.
- **Increased sensitivity to light or sound**: Makes it challenging to endure normal environments, highlighting the headache's severity.

## Can Thyroid Issues Cause Both Headaches and Neck Pain?

**Correlation Explained:**

Thyroid issues often cause systemic effects, including inflammation and hormonal imbalances, which can contribute to both headaches and neck pain. The thyroid gland's influence on metabolic rate and immune function can exacerbate pain sensitivity and inflammatory responses in the body.

**Examples of Conditions:**

- **Graves’ Disease**: This autoimmune disorder leads to an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism), which can increase the body’s sensitivity to pain.
- **Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis**: In this condition, the immune system attacks the thyroid, often causing fluctuating thyroid hormone levels which can result in periods of both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, thereby triggering headaches and neck pain.
