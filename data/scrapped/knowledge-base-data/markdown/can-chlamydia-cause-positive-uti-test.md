## Differences Between Chlamydia and UTI

[Chlamydia and UTIs](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/uti-vs-std) are infections caused by different bacteria.

Chlamydia is a sexually transmitted disease caused by **Chlamydia trachomatis**. The global prevalence of the condition among people aged 15–49 is estimated to be 4.0% for women and 2.5% for men, as per [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chlamydia).

Often, it has mild or [no symptoms for months and even years](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/how-long-can-chlamydia-be-dormant). When symptoms occur, they include [**genital discharge**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/what%20does%20chlamydia%20discharge%20look%20like), **burning during urination**, and **pain during sex**. In women, it can cause **lower abdominal pain** and **bleeding between periods**.

UTIs, or urinary tract infections, are usually caused by bacteria like **E. coli**. Approximately 40% of women and 12% of men will experience UTI symptoms at some point in their lives, [states](https://www.urologyhealth.org/healthy-living/urologyhealth-extra/magazine-archives/summer-2016/understanding-utis-across-the-lifespan) Urology Care Foundation.

UTIs cause more noticeable symptoms. These include a strong, persistent **urge to urinate**, a **burning sensation during urination**, and **cloudy or strong-smelling urine**. Some people might experience [**pelvic pain**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/pelvic-pain-in-men), [especially in women](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/stabbing-pain-in-pelvic-area-in-females), and fever if the infection spreads to the kidneys.

## Can Chlamydia Cause a Positive UTI Test?

Testing for chlamydia and UTIs involves different methods. A UTI test looks for bacteria in the urine. A chlamydia test checks for the specific bacteria causing the infection.

These two infections, chlamydia and UTIs, are caused by different bacteria (chlamydia- _Chlamydia trachomatis_; UTIs- _E. coli_.), which means that a **positive test for one does not indicate the presence of the other.**

It is important to identify the correct infection for proper treatment. Misdiagnosis can lead to ineffective treatments and prolonged symptoms. Always consult a healthcare provider if you experience symptoms of either infection. They will perform the appropriate tests to determine the exact cause of your symptoms.

## How Are Chlamydia and UTIs Diagnosed?

Chlamydia and UTIs are diagnosed using different methods. Here are the methods used to diagnose each condition:

**Chlamydia Diagnosis:**

- **Swab Test:** For women, a swab is taken from the cervix during a pelvic exam. For men, a swab from the urethra may be used.
- [**Urine Test**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/urinalysis-test) **:** A urine sample is analyzed to detect the bacteria causing chlamydia.

**UTI Diagnosis:**

- **Urine Test:** A sample of urine is examined for the presence of bacteria, red blood cells, and white blood cells.
- **Urine Culture:** Identifies the specific type of bacteria causing the infection, helping in choosing the most effective antibiotic.

Accurate testing is essential for both conditions. Misdiagnosis can lead to incorrect treatments, prolonged symptoms, and potential complications. If you experience symptoms of chlamydia or a UTI, consult a healthcare provider. They will determine which tests are needed based on your symptoms.

## Prevention of Chlamydia and UTIs

Preventing chlamydia and UTIs involves different strategies.

**[UTI prevention](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/how-to-prevent-uti) tips from the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/uti/about/index.html)**:

- Urinate after sexual activity.
- Stay well hydrated.
- Take showers instead of baths.
- Minimize douching, sprays or powders in the genital area.
- Teach girls when potty training to wipe front to back.

**To prevent chlamydia [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chlamydia/) recommends**:

- Using a condom every time you have vaginal or anal sex.
- Using a condom to cover the penis during oral sex.
- Using a dam (a piece of thin, soft plastic or latex) to cover the female genitals during oral sex or when rubbing female genitals together.
- Not sharing sex toys.
