## What is gallbladder surgery?

Gallbladder surgery, also known as **cholecystectomy**, is a medical procedure to remove the gallbladder. The gallbladder is a small organ located beneath the liver, responsible for storing bile. Bile is a digestive fluid produced by the liver that helps in digesting fats.

Gallbladder surgery is often performed for [several reasons](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/signs-to-remove-gallbladder), for example when a person suffers from [gallstones](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/gallbladder-stones-size-for-surgery) or other gallbladder-related issues that cause pain, inflammation, or infection.

The surgery can be done using traditional open surgery or a minimally invasive technique called laparoscopic surgery, which involves smaller incisions and faster recovery.

## Why is your stomach bigger after gallbladder surgery?

After gallbladder surgery, some patients notice that their stomachs appear bigger or bloated. This is usually temporary and can happen for a few reasons.

During laparoscopic surgery, the abdomen is inflated with **gas** to give surgeons more room to work, which can cause temporary bloating.

Additionally, **changes in digestion** after gallbladder removal may lead to gas and bloating as your body adjusts to the absence of the gallbladder.

This bloating usually decreases within a few days to weeks as the body heals and adjusts. It's important to follow a post-surgery diet and stay active to help reduce bloating.

## Gallbladder surgery recovery time

The recovery time after gallbladder surgery varies depending on the type of surgery performed.

For **laparoscopic** gallbladder surgery, most patients can go home the same day or the next day. According to the [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gallbladder-removal/) recovery usually takes about **two weeks**, with most people returning to their normal activities within this period.

However, if **open surgery** is performed, the recovery time can be longer, typically around **six to eight weeks**.

During recovery, it's essential to follow your doctor's advice on activity levels, diet, and wound care to ensure a smooth healing process.

## How to treat gallbladder surgery scars

Gallbladder surgery scars are typically small and can be managed effectively. Here are some tips to help treat and minimize these scars:

- **Keep the incision sites clean and dry**: This helps prevent infection and promotes proper healing.
- **Follow your doctor’s wound care instructions**: Use any prescribed ointments or creams as directed to support healing.
- **Avoid exposing scars to direct sunlight**: Sun exposure can darken scars, making them more noticeable. Use sunscreen if exposure is unavoidable.
- **Consider using silicone gels or sheets**: These can help reduce the appearance of scars over time.
- **Consult your doctor about advanced treatments**: If scars remain a concern, options like laser therapy may be recommended.

These steps can help ensure your scars heal well and become less visible over time.

## Post-gallbladder surgery diet

After gallbladder surgery, your body needs time to adjust to the absence of the gallbladder, which plays a role in digesting fats. Following a specific diet can help ease this transition and reduce digestive discomfort. Here are some dietary tips to follow after gallbladder surgery:

- **Start with a low-fat diet**: Eating low-fat foods helps your body adjust to digesting without the gallbladder. Choose lean meats, avoid fried foods, and use healthy fats like olive oil in moderation.
- **Eat small, frequent meals**: Smaller portions reduce the strain on your digestive system and can help prevent bloating and gas.
- **Gradually reintroduce high-fiber foods**: While fiber is important, introducing it slowly helps prevent digestive issues like diarrhea or cramping.
- **Stay hydrated**: Drinking plenty of water aids digestion and helps prevent constipation.
- **Limit** [**alcohol consumption**](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/alcohol-after-gallbladder-removal): Alcohol can be harsh on your digestive system after surgery and may lead to increased discomfort or diarrhea. It’s advisable to consume alcohol in moderation, and some people may find it helpful to avoid it entirely during the early stages of recovery.
- **Avoid gas-producing foods**: Foods like beans, carbonated drinks, and certain vegetables (e.g., broccoli, cabbage) can cause bloating, so it's best to limit them.

Following these dietary guidelines can help ensure a smoother recovery and minimize digestive discomfort after gallbladder surgery.
