## How Long Does an Allergy Cough Last?

An allergy cough happens when your body reacts to allergens like pollen, dust, or pet dander. This type of cough is usually dry and can be quite persistent.

The duration of an allergy cough depends on how long you're exposed to the [allergen](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/allergy-attack).

Once you're no longer in contact with the allergen, the cough should go away **within a few days**.

**Factors influencing duration**:

- Continuous exposure to the allergen
- Severity of your allergy
- Steps taken to avoid allergens

If your allergy cough lasts for several weeks or comes with other severe symptoms, it's important to see a healthcare professional.

## How Long Does a Dry Cough Last?

A dry cough is one that doesn't produce mucus and is often caused by **irritants**, [**viral infections**](https://docus.ai/tags/viral-infections), or certain medical conditions, such as **asthma** or [**acid reflux**](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/acid-reflux-cough).

Typically, a dry cough lasts **about three weeks**. If it's due to a viral infection, it should get better on its own.

**Factors influencing duration**:

- Exposure to irritants
- Underlying health issues
- Overall health

If your dry cough sticks around for **more than three weeks** or comes with symptoms like chest pain or trouble breathing, it's a good idea to consult a healthcare professional.

## How Long Does a Wet Cough Last?

A wet cough, also known as a **productive cough**, produces mucus or [**phlegm**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/about-phlegm-after-eating). It is often caused by infections, such as the common **cold** or **bronchitis**.

A wet cough typically lasts for **about three weeks**. If it's caused by an infection, it should improve as the infection clears.

**Factors influencing duration**:

- Severity of the infection
- Presence of underlying conditions, such as chronic bronchitis or pneumonia
- Overall health and immune system strength

If a wet cough persists for **more than three weeks** or is accompanied by symptoms like high fever, shortness of breath, or blood in the mucus, it's important to see a healthcare professional.

## How Long Does a Croup cough Last?

A [croup cough](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/what-your-cough-sound-says-about-your-health#what-does-a-croup-cough-sound-like) is characterized by a distinctive **barking** sound and is caused by a **viral infection** that inflames the windpipe, larynx, and bronchi.

This condition is common in young children, and according to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8277-croup), it affects about **3%** of U.S. children annually.

A croup cough usually lasts for about three to seven days. The worst symptoms typically occur during the first two to three days.

**Factors influencing duration**:

- Severity of the viral infection
- Age and overall health of the child
- How quickly treatment is started

If the croup cough is severe, causes breathing difficulties, or lasts **more than a week**, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional.
