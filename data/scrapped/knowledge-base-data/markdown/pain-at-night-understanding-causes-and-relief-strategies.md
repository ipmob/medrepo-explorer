## Why is pain worse at night?

Pain often feels worse at night due to fewer distractions, making discomfort more noticeable. During the day, activities and interactions can divert attention from pain.

Several factors contribute to this increase, including the body's **circadian rhythms**, which affect pain perception. **Lower levels of natural pain-relieving hormones** at night can also make pain more intense.

At night, without daily distractions, the mind may focus more on the pain, amplifying its perception. **Lower temperatures** can cause muscles and joints to stiffen, increasing pain levels.

Many conditions can worsen pain at night, such as **arthritis**, **fibromyalgia**, **peripheral neuropathy**, [**sciatica**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/immediate-relief-for-sciatica-pain), and **restless leg syndrome**.

**Migraines**, **chronic [back pain](https://docus.ai/tags/back-pain)**, **tendinitis**, **bursitis**, and **[gastroesophageal reflux disease](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/overview-of-gerd)**(GERD) can also become more intense when lying down.

## Leg pain at night

[Leg pain at night](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/understanding-aching-legs-at-night) can be caused by various factors, including:

- **Muscle cramps**: Sudden, involuntary contractions of leg muscles, often due to dehydration, overuse, or electrolyte imbalances.
- **Poor circulation**: Reduced blood flow to the legs can cause pain, often associated with conditions like peripheral artery disease.
- **Nerve issues**: Conditions such as neuropathy or sciatica can lead to sharp, burning, or [tingling pain in the legs](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/tingling-in-lower-legs).
- **Restless leg syndrome**: A condition causing an uncontrollable urge to move the legs, often accompanied by uncomfortable sensations. The Mayo Clinic [states](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/restless-legs-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20377168) that restless leg syndrome can start at any age and typically worsens as one gets older.
- **Arthritis**: Inflammation of the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and swelling, which can worsen at night due to inactivity.

Leg pain at night can significantly disrupt sleep quality, causing frequent awakenings and difficulty falling asleep. Poor sleep can lead to fatigue and negatively impact overall health.
