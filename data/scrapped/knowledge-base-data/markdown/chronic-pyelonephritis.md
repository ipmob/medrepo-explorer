## What is Chronic Pyelonephritis?

Chronic pyelonephritis is a **long-term kidney infection** that can cause **permanent kidney damage**.

It **results from repeated kidney infections** or **persistent [infections](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/bladder-infection-vs-uti)**.

Unlike acute pyelonephritis, which is a sudden and severe infection, chronic pyelonephritis develops slowly over time.

According to the Cleveland Clinic [data](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15456-kidney-infection-pyelonephritis), about **1 in 2,000** people in the U.S. get a kidney infection each year, which can progress to chronic pyelonephritis if not properly treated.

This condition often occurs in individuals with **urinary tract obstructions** or **vesicoureteral reflux**, where urine flows backward from the bladder to the kidneys.

Early detection and management are crucial to prevent serious complications.

## Chronic Obstructive Pyelonephritis

Chronic obstructive pyelonephritis occurs when long-term kidney infection is accompanied by an **obstruction in the urinary tract**.

This obstruction can be due to conditions like **[kidney stones](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/what-can-mimic-kidney-stone-pain)**, **tumors**, or **congenital abnormalities**.

Unlike non-obstructive pyelonephritis, the obstructive form leads to increased pressure in the kidneys, further damaging the renal tissue.

This condition significantly impacts kidney function and increases the risk of **chronic kidney disease**.

Early detection and removal of the obstruction are essential for managing this condition.

## Chronic Pyelonephritis Symptoms

Symptoms of chronic pyelonephritis can vary but often include:

- Persistent back or flank pain
- [Fever](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/when-to-go-to-the-hospital-for-fever) and chills
- [Frequent urination](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/frequent-urination-before-period-causes-and-management)
- Strong urge to urinate
- Painful urination
- Fatigue
- [Nausea](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/cases-of-long-lasting-nausea)
- Weight loss

If left untreated, chronic pyelonephritis can lead to severe complications like **kidney failure** or **high blood pressure**.

Recognizing symptoms early and seeking medical attention is important for managing this condition effectively.

## Diagnosis of Chronic Pyelonephritis

Diagnosing chronic pyelonephritis involves several steps:

1. **Clinical evaluation**: Includes a detailed medical history and physical examination.
2. **Urinalysis**: Detects infections and assesses urine composition.
3. **Blood tests**: Evaluate kidney function and overall health.
4. **Imaging studies**: Ultrasounds or CT scans visualize kidney structure and identify abnormalities.
5. **Renal biopsy**: In some cases, confirms the diagnosis by examining kidney tissue.

Early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and preventing further kidney damage.

## Chronic Pyelonephritis Treatment

Treatment for chronic pyelonephritis involves [managing the infection](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/get-rid-of-uti-in-24-hours) and addressing any underlying causes.

General treatment approaches include **prolonged use of antibiotics** to clear the infection.

Lifestyle changes, such as **increasing fluid intake** and **maintaining good hygiene**, are recommended.

Dietary adjustments, like **reducing salt** and **protein intake**, can help support kidney health.

Long-term management includes regular follow-up appointments and monitoring kidney function to prevent complications.

Early and consistent treatment is key to managing chronic pyelonephritis effectively.
