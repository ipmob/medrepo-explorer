## What are STDs?

Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are **infections** passed through sexual contact. They are common and significant health issues worldwide. STDs are infections **transmitted primarily through sexual activity**.

Although, there are [other ways of transmission](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/std-without-sex), such as through blood transfusions, sharing needles, or from mother to child during childbirth or breastfeeding. They affect various parts of the body and can have serious health consequences.

According to the [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/sexually-transmitted-infections-(stis)?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwqf20BhBwEiwAt7dtdSQToejixlEMusUtc0qbri1yQEGuGIpH5iIbFLqnW9JHgxR6bju0phoCMYMQAvD_BwE), every day, more than **1 million** curable sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are acquired globally among people aged **15–49**. Most of these infections are asymptomatic, meaning many people may not even realize they are infected.

Common STDs include **chlamydia**, **gonorrhea**, **syphilis**, and **herpes**. These infections can impact reproductive health and overall well-being. STDs are spread through vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Safe practices, like using condoms, can reduce the risk of transmission.

**Causes of STDs include**:

- Unprotected sex
- Multiple sexual partners
- Sharing needles
- Infected mother to child during birth

Preventing STDs involves using protection during sex, getting vaccinated, and having regular health check-ups. Early detection and treatment are crucial.

## What are UTIs?

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common **infections** affecting the urinary system. They occur frequently and can be quite [painful](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/how-to-relieve-uti-pain). UTIs are infections in any part of the urinary tract, including the **kidneys**, **bladder**, and **urethra**. They cause discomfort and require treatment.

This condition can be quite frequent, For example, each year, UTIs result in over **8.1 million** visits to healthcare providers, [notes](https://www.urologyhealth.org/urology-a-z/u/urinary-tract-infections-in-adults) Urology Care Foundation.

[UTIs](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/bladder-infection-vs-uti#what-is-a-uti) can infect the bladder (cystitis), urethra (urethritis), and kidneys (pyelonephritis). These infections can lead to severe complications if untreated. UTIs are commonly caused by bacteria entering the urinary tract. Factors like **poor hygiene** and **dehydration** increase the risk of UTIs.

**Causes of UTIs include**:

- Poor personal hygiene
- Holding urine for too long
- Dehydration
- [Sexual activity](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/uti-after-sex)
- Use of certain types of birth control

The [duration of a UTI](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/how-long-does-a-uti-last) can vary, but with proper treatment, symptoms typically improve within a few days. In some cases, it may take up to a week for symptoms to fully resolve. Without treatment, UTIs can persist and lead to more severe health issues.

[Preventing UTIs](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/how-to-prevent-uti) involves maintaining good hygiene, staying hydrated, and urinating regularly. Cranberry products may also help reduce UTI risk.

## UTI vs STD: Symptoms

UTIs and STDs have different symptoms, though some may overlap. It's important to distinguish between the two for proper treatment. Additionally, symptoms can present differently depending on gender.

For example, the [article](https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(02)01054-9/abstract) from The American Journal of Medicine states that women are up to **30 times** more likely to get a UTI than men due to their **shorter urethra**.

**Symptoms of a UTI include**:

- Pain or burning sensation during urination
- Frequent urge to urinate, often with little urine (can intensify [before periods](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/frequent-urination-before-period-causes-and-management) in females)
- Cloudy or strong-smelling urine
- [Pain in the lower abdomen or back](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/pelvic-and-lower-back-pain)
- [Pelvic pain (more common in females](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/stabbing-pain-in-pelvic-area-in-females) though can occur in [males](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/pelvic-pain-in-men))
- Fever or chills in severe cases

**Symptoms of STDs vary depending on the type, but common signs include**:

- Painful or burning sensation during urination
- [Some types lead to unusual discharge](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/what%20does%20chlamydia%20discharge%20look%20like) from the penis or vagina
- Genital sores or blisters
- Itching or irritation in the genital area
- Pain during intercourse
- Pelvic pain (more common in females)
- Testicular pain (specific to males)
- Rectal pain or discharge (can occur in both but often in males who have sex with males)

Recognizing these symptoms and seeking medical advice is crucial for effective treatment and prevention of complications.

## UTI vs STD: Diagnosis

Diagnosing UTIs and STDs involves different methods, but both require medical testing for accurate results.

**To diagnose a UTI, doctors typically**:

- Perform a [urine test](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/urinalysis-test) to detect bacteria or white blood cells.
- Conduct a physical examination to check for tenderness in the abdomen or back.
- Sometimes use imaging tests if infections are frequent or severe.

**To diagnose an STD, healthcare providers may**:

- Conduct a physical examination of the genital area.
- Take samples of blood, urine, or swabs from the genital area.
- Use specific tests for certain STDs, such as a [Pap smear](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/pap-smear) or HIV test.

Prior to seeing a doctor, you can use the [Lab Test Results Interpretation](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation) tools for easy interpretation and health insights, This tool provides clear explanations and helps understand your test results better. Early diagnosis through these methods ensures timely and appropriate treatment, reducing the risk of complications and transmission.

## UTI vs STD: Treatment

Treating UTIs and STDs involves different approaches, tailored to the specific type of infection and its severity.

**Treatment for a UTI typically includes**:

- Antibiotics to kill the bacteria causing the infection.
- Drinking plenty of water to help flush out the bacteria.
- Pain relief medications to reduce discomfort.

**Treatment for STDs varies depending on the type of infection**:

- Antibiotics are used for bacterial STDs like chlamydia and gonorrhea.
- Antiviral medications are prescribed for viral STDs like herpes.
- Topical treatments may be used for certain symptoms like genital sores.

Additionally, informing sexual partners and encouraging them to get tested is crucial to prevent the spread of STDs. Regular follow-up appointments ensure the infection is fully treated and help monitor for any potential complications.

**Caution**: _Before starting any new medication, you must consult a doctor. It's essential to follow the prescribed treatment plan and complete the entire course of medication._
