Sperm and semen are often confused, but they are not the same. Sperm are tiny cells that fertilize an egg, while semen is the fluid that carries and protects them.

## What Is Semen?

Semen is a **special fluid** that helps transport and protect sperm during reproduction. It’s made up of several important components, each with a unique role:

- **Sperm**: The tiny cells that fertilize the egg.
- **Fructose**: A sugar that gives sperm the energy they need to swim.
- **Prostate Fluid**: Helps make semen less acidic, so sperm can survive in the female body.
- **Seminal Vesicle Fluid**: Provides most of the semen’s volume and includes nutrients and proteins to keep sperm healthy.
- **Minerals like Zinc**: Protect sperm and keep their genetic material safe.
- **Enzymes**: Help semen become more fluid after ejaculation, making it easier for sperm to move.
- **Mucus**: Makes the semen slippery, helping sperm swim smoothly through the reproductive system.

Each part of semen works together to give sperm the best chance of reaching and fertilizing an egg.

Semen isn’t stored as one fluid. Its parts are kept in different glands and mixed only during ejaculation (the release of semen from the penis during sexual activity).

Most of the semen’s volume comes from glandular fluids. About **65% to 75%** is produced by the seminal vesicles, **25% to 30%** by the prostate gland, and only **1% to 5%** consists of sperm.

These parts work together to produce and release semen when needed, ensuring the best chance for successful reproduction.

## What Is Sperm?

Sperm are microscopic **male reproductive cells** that are essential for creating life. They are produced in the testes through a process called **spermatogenesis**. This process begins at puberty and continues throughout a man’s life.

Each sperm cell has three main parts:

- The **head** holds the genetic material (DNA) to combine with an egg.
- The **midpiece** gives the sperm energy to move, thanks to tiny structures called mitochondria, which act like power plants.
- The **tail** helps the sperm swim toward the egg.

Sperm are stored in the epididymis (a small tube behind the testes where sperm are kept and matured) until they mix with semen and are released during ejaculation.

These cells are incredibly small but powerful. Each sperm measures just [0.003–0.005 millimeters in length](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/andr.12500#:~:text=A%20typical%20human%20spermatozoon%20has,by%20acrosome%20and%20plasma%20membrane.), yet millions are released in a single ejaculation.

Their sole purpose is to fertilize an egg, making them crucial for reproduction.

## What Is the Difference Between Sperm and Semen?

Sperm and semen are both crucial for reproduction but are not the same. Many people confuse them because sperm is a part of semen, but they have different roles.

Check out the comparison of the main differences below for a better understanding:

**Definition**

- **Sperm:** Microscopic cells responsible for fertilizing an egg.
- **Semen:** Fluid that carries sperm and provides nutrients and protection.

**Composition**

- **Sperm:** Head  (DNA), midpiece (energy), tail (movement)
- **Semen:** Sperm (1-5% of semen), fluids from the seminal vesicles, prostate fluid, enzymes and nutrients

**Function**

- **Sperm:** Fertilize the egg to enable reproduction.
- **Semen:** Transports, nourishes, and protects sperm.

In short, sperm are individual cells, while semen is the complete fluid that delivers and supports them during reproduction.

## Can There Be Semen Without Sperm?

Yes, semen can exist without sperm. This condition, called **azoospermia**, happens when the body doesn’t make sperm or when a blockage stops sperm from mixing with semen.

Even without sperm, the other fluids in semen are still produced and released.

Azoospermia can significantly affect fertility because sperm are necessary to fertilize an egg. Without sperm in the semen, natural conception is not possible.

However, with the right medical care, some causes of azoospermia can be treated to improve fertility.

To diagnose this condition, doctors perform a [**semen analysis**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/semen-analysis-purpose). They examine the semen under a microscope to check for sperm and assess their health.

Also, before puberty, boys do not produce sperm because the process of sperm production has not started yet. During early puberty, the body starts making seminal fluid, but it doesn’t contain sperm cells yet.
