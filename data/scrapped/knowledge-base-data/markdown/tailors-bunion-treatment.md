## How to Get Rid of Tailor's Bunion Without Surgery?

A tailor's [bunion](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/gout-vs-bunion#what-is-a-bunion) is a bony bump on the outside of the foot, near the little toe. Non-surgical treatments are important for managing symptoms effectively:

1\. **Footwear Adjustments**

- Wear Proper Shoes: Choose shoes with a wide toe box to reduce pressure on the bunion.
- Avoid High Heels: High heels can exacerbate the problem by putting more pressure on the bunion.
- Custom Orthotics: Use custom orthotic inserts to help redistribute pressure away from the bunion.

2\. **Padding and Taping**

- Bunion Pads: Apply bunion pads to cushion the area and reduce friction.
- Toe Spacers: Use toe spacers to help keep toes aligned and relieve pressure.
- Taping: Tape your foot in a way that aligns the toe and reduces pressure on the bunion.

3\. **Lifestyle and Home Remedies**

- Ice Therapy: Apply ice packs to the bunion for 15-20 minutes several times a day to reduce swelling.
- Anti-inflammatory Medications: Take over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications to reduce pain and inflammation.
- Foot Exercises: Perform foot exercises that strengthen the muscles around the bunion and improve flexibility.

4\. **Professional Treatments**

- Physical Therapy: Consult a physical therapist for exercises and treatments to alleviate symptoms.
- Corticosteroid Injections: In some cases, a doctor may recommend corticosteroid injections to reduce severe inflammation.
- Custom Orthotic Devices: See a podiatrist for custom-made orthotic devices that provide better support and alignment.

If non-surgical treatments are ineffective, consider discussing surgical options with a specialist.

## Tailor's Bunion Surgery

Tailor's bunion surgery, also known as **bunionette surgery**, aims to correct a bony bump on the outside of the foot near the little toe. The procedure involves removing or reshaping the bone and soft tissue to reduce pain and improve foot function.

**Types of surgery**:

- Exostectomy: This involves removing the bony bump without correcting the underlying bone structure.
- Osteotomy: This involves cutting and realigning the bone to correct the bunionette.
- Arthroplasty: This involves reshaping the bone and removing part of the joint.
- Arthrodesis: This involves fusing the joint to correct severe deformities.

The surgery typically lasts between **30 minutes to 1 hour**, depending on the type of procedure and severity of the bunionette.

Recovery can vary but generally takes about **6-8 weeks**. Patients usually need to wear a special surgical shoe or boot for a few weeks. Physical therapy may be recommended to regain strength and mobility.

Risks include **infection**, **nerve damage**, and recurrence of the bunionette.

According to Wolters Kluwer Technology [data](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/news/after-bunion-surgery-immediate-x-rays-predict-recurrence-risk), the recurrence rate of tailor's bunions after surgery is around 5-10%, with some studies suggesting up to **25%** over a patient's lifetime​.
