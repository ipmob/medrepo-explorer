## Pain Behind Knee When Squatting

Pain behind the knee when squatting can be caused by **overuse**, **poor posture**, or **sudden injury**. Activities that involve repeated bending and stress on the knee, such as sports, can lead to this pain.

Conditions such as a **Baker's cyst**, **hamstring tendonitis**, or **meniscus tears** might be responsible for the pain behind the knee. These conditions often result from excessive stress or improper movement.

**Recommended actions** and **preventative measures**:

- Apply ice to the affected area to reduce inflammation.
- Rest your knee to prevent further injury.
- Perform gentle stretching and strengthening exercises for the hamstrings and quadriceps.
- Avoid activities that aggravate the pain.
- Maintain proper form when squatting to prevent further issues.

## Top of Knee Pain When Squatting

Pain at the top of the knee when squatting is often due to strain or **overuse of the quadriceps tendon**.

**Improper squatting technique** can also contribute to this pain.

Conditions like **quadriceps tendonitis** or **patellar tendinopathy** may be the underlying causes of pain at the top of the knee. These conditions typically develop from repetitive stress or improper alignment.

**Recommended actions** and **preventative measures**:

- Rest the knee and avoid activities that cause pain.
- Use ice to reduce inflammation and swelling.
- Perform gentle quadriceps and hip flexor stretches.
- Strengthen the surrounding muscles to support the knee.
- Ensure proper squatting technique to prevent further injury.

## Outside Knee Pain When Squatting

Outside knee pain when squatting can often result from **overuse**, i **mproper technique**, or **sudden twisting movements**.

Activities that involve lateral movements, such as **running** or **jumping**, can place extra stress on the outside of the knee.

Potential underlying conditions:

- **Iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS)** is a common cause of outside knee pain, often due to inflammation of the iliotibial band. According to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21967-iliotibial-band-syndrome), Iliotibial band syndrome accounts for about 12% of running injuries.
- **Lateral meniscus tears** or ligament injuries might also cause pain in the outer part of the knee.
- Conditions such as **lateral collateral ligament (LCL) sprain** or **tendonitis** can also contribute to this pain.

**Recommended actions** and **preventative Measures**:

- Rest and avoid activities that exacerbate the pain.
- Apply ice to reduce inflammation and swelling.
- Perform gentle stretching and strengthening exercises for the iliotibial band, hip abductors, and quadriceps.
- Use a foam roller to massage the iliotibial band to alleviate tightness.
- Ensure proper squatting technique, keeping knees aligned with the toes to prevent further injury.
