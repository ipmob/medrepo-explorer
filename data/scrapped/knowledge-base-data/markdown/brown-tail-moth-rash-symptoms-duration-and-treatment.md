## What is Brown-Tail Moth Rash?

Brown-tail moth rash is a skin condition caused by **contact with the toxic hairs of the brown-tail moth caterpillar**. The rash typically develops when these tiny, barbed **hairs embed into the skin**, leading to an allergic reaction, according to the [NPS](https://www.nps.gov/articles/browntail-moth-in-acadia.htm).

This reaction results in **red**, **itchy bump** s that can form clusters and spread across the affected area. The rash is common in areas exposed to the caterpillar's hairs, such as the **arms**, **neck**, and **face**.

The severity of the rash can vary, with some individuals experiencing mild irritation and others suffering from intense itching and inflammation.

**Causes**

- **Contact with caterpillar hairs**: The primary cause is direct contact with the brown tail moth caterpillar's toxic hairs.
- **Airborne hairs**: The hairs can become airborne and cause a rash when they land on the skin.
- **Contaminated clothing or surfaces**: Touching clothing, bedding, or surfaces contaminated with the caterpillar's hairs can also lead to the rash.
- **Seasonal activity**: The risk of developing the rash is higher during late spring and summer when the caterpillars are most active.

## What Does Brown-Tail Moth Rash Look Like?

Brown tail moth rash looks like **small, red bumps on the skin**. These bumps may form clusters and spread.

The rash is often **itchy** and can become **inflamed**. It may also develop into a blistering condition if scratched.

Look for raised, red bumps that are itchy and in clusters. The rash typically appears on **exposed skin areas**.

## Symptoms of Brown-Tail Moth Rash

**Initial symptoms**

- Tingling or burning sensation on the skin
- Red bumps appearing shortly after contact

As the rash progresses, the itching can become **more intense**. The rash area may also swell and become more irritated. The rash can cause significant itching and discomfort. Scratching may lead to further irritation and potential skin infections.

## How Long Does Brown-Tail Moth Rash Last?

The duration of a brown tail moth rash can vary depending on the severity of the reaction and the individual's skin sensitivity. Typically, the rash lasts for a **few days to a couple of weeks**. In most cases, the intense itching and redness subside **within a week**.

However, if the rash is severe or if there has been extensive contact with the caterpillar hairs, the symptoms might persist for **up to two weeks**. Proper care and avoiding further exposure to the hairs can help shorten the duration of the rash.

## How to Treat Brown-Tail Moth Rash?

[Treating](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/rash-treatment-at-home) brown tail moth rash involves a combination of relieving symptoms and preventing further irritation. Here are some steps to manage the rash:

- **Clean the affected area**: Gently wash the skin with soap and water to remove any remaining caterpillar hairs.
- **Avoid scratching**: Scratching can worsen the rash and lead to infections. Keep nails short to minimize damage.
- **Cool compresses**: Applying cool, wet compresses can help reduce itching and swelling.
- **Moisturize**: Use gentle moisturizers to soothe dry and irritated skin.
- **Avoid further exposure**: Stay away from areas where brown-tail moth caterpillars are present, and wear protective clothing when necessary.
- **Consult a healthcare professional**: If the rash is severe or persists, seek medical advice for additional treatment options.
