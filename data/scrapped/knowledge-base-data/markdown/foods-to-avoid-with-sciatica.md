Harvard Health [reports](https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/sciatica-of-all-the-nerve#:~:text=As%20many%20as%2040%25%20of,more%20frequent%20as%20you%20age.) that up to **40%** of people will experience sciatica during their lifetime, with occurrences more frequent as individuals age.

Individuals with sciatica may find their [symptoms worsen](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/signs-sciatica-getting-worse) after consuming certain types of foods, particularly those that promote inflammation.

- **Saturated Fats**: Unhealthy fats, found in foods like red meat and full-fat dairy, contribute to inflammatory processes. These fats can aggravate inflammation around the sciatic nerve, leading to increased pain. _(Examples: butter, cheese, fatty cuts of beef)._
