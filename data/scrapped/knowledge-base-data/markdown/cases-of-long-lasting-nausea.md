## What Causes Long Lasting Nausea?

- **Gastrointestinal Issues**: Conditions affecting the stomach and intestines can lead to prolonged nausea. Issues such as [acid reflux](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/overview-of-gerd), ulcers, and gastritis are common culprits.
- **Infections**: [Viral](https://docus.ai/tags/viral-infections) or bacterial infections may cause nausea that persists. Common examples include food poisoning, stomach flu, and hepatitis.
- **Inner Ear Problems**: Inner ear disorders can affect balance and lead to long-term nausea. Conditions like [vertigo](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/sinus-infection-vertigo-symptoms-causes-and-management) or Meniere’s disease are often responsible.
- **Stress and Anxiety**: Psychological factors like stress and [anxiety](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/how-to-recognize-anxiety-in-yourself-and-others) can contribute to prolonged nausea. These conditions can trigger a physical response in the body.
- [**Pregnancy**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/foods-for-nausea-during-pregnancy): Hormonal changes [during pregnancy](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/managing-nausea-in-the-third-trimester) can cause extended periods of nausea. This is often referred to as morning sickness, although it can last all day.
- **Chronic Conditions**: Chronic diseases such as [diabetes](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/about-diabetes-toenails) or kidney disease may have nausea as a symptom. Managing these conditions is crucial to reducing nausea.
- **Medications and Treatments**: Certain medications and treatments may cause long-lasting nausea as a side effect. Chemotherapy drugs like cisplatin and pain relievers such as ibuprofen and aspirin are known examples. According to the [American Cancer Society](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/nausea/nausea-hp-pdq#:~:text=Chemotherapy%2Dinduced%20N%26V%20is%20one,Serious%20metabolic%20derangements.), nausea is a common side effect of chemotherapy, affecting 70-80% of patients.

## How to Treat Long Lasting Nausea?

- **Dietary Changes**: Adjusting your diet can help manage nausea symptoms. Eating smaller, more frequent meals and avoiding spicy or fatty foods may help.
- **Hydration**: Staying hydrated is crucial in alleviating nausea. Sipping clear fluids like water, broth, or herbal tea can be beneficial.
- **Rest and Relaxation**: Adequate rest and stress management can reduce nausea. Practices like deep breathing, meditation, and gentle exercise can be helpful.
- [**Natural Remedies**](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/remedies-and-foods-to-help-with-nausea): Ginger, peppermint, and other natural remedies may provide relief. These can be consumed as teas, candies, or supplements.
- **Medical Consultation**: Seeking advice from a healthcare provider can help identify and treat the underlying cause. A doctor can perform tests and suggest appropriate treatments.
- **Medication Adjustments**: Discussing medication changes with a doctor may alleviate nausea symptoms. Sometimes switching medications or adjusting doses can make a difference.
- **Therapies**: Cognitive behavioral therapy and other therapies can help manage nausea related to anxiety and stress. These approaches can address the psychological factors contributing to nausea.
