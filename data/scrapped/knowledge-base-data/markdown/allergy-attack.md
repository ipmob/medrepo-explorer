Allergy attacks occur when the immune system **overreacts to harmless substances**, treating them as threats. Symptoms range from sneezing and itchy eyes to more severe reactions like difficulty breathing and swelling.

Understanding the triggers and managing the symptoms is key to handling these attacks effectively.

## What is an allergy attack?

An allergy attack, also known as an allergic reaction, occurs when the **immune system reacts to a normally harmless substance** as if it is a threat.

**Symptoms**:

- [Sneezing](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/pain-when-sneezing-tips-and-info) and nasal congestion, often accompanied by a runny or itchy nose.
- Itchy, watery eyes which may be red and swollen.
- Skin reactions such as [hives](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/hives-vs-rash), [redness](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/red-feet-uncovered), or [itching](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/itchy-roof-of-mouth).
- [Difficulty breathing](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/shortness-of-breath-after-eating-causes-and-relief), which may include wheezing or shortness of breath.
- Swelling of the [lips](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/understanding-lip-filler-swelling), [tongue](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/itchy-tongue), or throat, which can be particularly dangerous.

An allergy attack can significantly affect daily activities by causing discomfort, reducing productivity, and in severe cases, requiring medical attention to manage acute symptoms.

## What causes a sudden allergy attack?

Common allergens that can trigger a sudden allergy attack include:

- **Pollen**: Often associated with seasonal allergies, pollen can provoke significant reactions.
- **Dust mites**: Tiny organisms found in household dust that can cause year-round allergies.
- **Pet dander**: Small flakes of skin shed by cats, dogs, and other furry or feathered pets.
- **Certain foods**: Common [food allergens](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/nightshade-allergy) include nuts, shellfish, milk, and eggs.
- **Insect stings**: Bee and wasp stings are typical triggers for severe allergic reactions.
- **Mold**: Spores from mold can trigger respiratory symptoms similar to those caused by other airborne allergens.

These triggers are quite prevalent, as evidenced by recent data from the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2022/20220126.htm), which noted that nearly **1 in 3 U.S. adults** and more than **1 in 4 U.S. children** reported having a seasonal allergy, eczema, or food allergy in 2021.

Exposure to these triggers can lead to the rapid onset of allergy symptoms, which in some cases, may require immediate medical attention.

## How to stop an allergy attack?

To stop an allergy attack and get relief, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Trigger**: Determine what is causing your allergic reaction, such as pollen, pet dander, or certain foods.
2. **Remove the Allergen**: If possible, remove yourself from the presence of the allergen or eliminate it from your environment.
3. **Take Medication**: Over-the-counter antihistamines can relieve symptoms like itching, sneezing, and runny nose. Always use medications as directed by a healthcare professional.
4. **Use a Nasal Spray**: Saline nasal sprays can help clear allergens from your nasal passages and reduce symptoms.
5. **Stay Hydrated**: Drink plenty of fluids to help thin mucus and ease congestion.
6. **Consider Allergy Shots**: For severe or chronic allergies, consult a doctor about allergy immunotherapy, which can reduce the severity of your reactions over time.

If your symptoms are severe, such as difficulty breathing or swelling, seek immediate medical attention as this could be a sign of anaphylaxis, a life-threatening reaction.
