## What is Cholesterol Granuloma?

Cholesterol granuloma is a **type of cyst** that forms when [cholesterol](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/cholesterol) deposits accumulate. These cysts often appear in the **middle ear** or **petrous apex**. They contain cholesterol crystals, fluid, and other debris, surrounded by an inflammatory response.

This condition can lead to a variety of symptoms, impacting the affected area significantly. It is **non-cancerous** but can cause discomfort and other complications.

## What Causes Cholesterol Granuloma?

Cholesterol granuloma forms due to **chronic inflammation** and **blockage in the ear or sinus areas**. The blockage prevents normal drainage, leading to fluid accumulation.

Over time, cholesterol crystals and other materials build up, triggering an inflammatory response. This process results in the formation of a granuloma.

**Chronic ear infections**, **trauma**, or **previous surgeries** can increase the risk of developing this condition.

Healthline [notes](https://www.healthline.com/health/cholesterol/cholesterol-granuloma-symptoms#the-cholesterol-connection) that cholesterol granulomas seem more common in families with familial **hypercholesterolemia**, though a proven link is lacking.

## Cholesterol Granuloma Symptoms

Cholesterol granuloma can cause various symptoms depending on its location. Common symptoms include:

- **Hearing loss**: Occurs due to the cyst pressing on ear structures.
- **The feeling of fullness or pressure in the ear**: Caused by the accumulation of fluid.
- [**Dizziness**](https://docus.ai/tags/dizziness) **or balance problems**: Arise if the granuloma affects the inner ear.
- **Tinnitus (ringing in the ears)**: A frequent symptom experienced by patients.
- **Facial pain or paralysis**: May occur if the granuloma impacts nearby nerves.

According to [UPMC](https://www.upmc.com/services/neurosurgery/brain/conditions/brain-tumors/cholesterol-granuloma), if not treated and the mass keeps growing, cholesterol granulomas of the petrous apex can lead to **permanent hearing loss**, **nerve damage**, and **bone destruction**.

## Cholesterol Granuloma Diagnostics

Diagnosing cholesterol granuloma involves several steps, including:

- **Medical history and physical examination**: Initial assessment by a healthcare provider.
- **Imaging studies**: MRI or CT scans to visualize the cyst and surrounding structures.
- **Hearing tests**: Assessing the impact on hearing function.
- **Biopsy**: In some cases, a sample may be taken to confirm the diagnosis.

## Cholesterol Granuloma Treatment

Treatment for cholesterol granuloma often involves various approaches, including:

- **Surgical intervention**: Removal of the cyst to alleviate symptoms and prevent recurrence.
- **Draining the cyst**: Procedure to improve drainage pathways and reduce fluid buildup.
- **Non-surgical options**: Managing symptoms with decongestants or therapies to reduce inflammation and promote drainage.

Regular follow-up is important to monitor for any recurrence or complications.
