When uric acid builds up, it forms sharp **crystals in joints**, causing pain and inflammation. Gout can affect any joint, including those in the hand, leading to swelling, redness, and discomfort.\n\nAccording to [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325208391_Hand_involvement_in_gout), damage to the hand in patients with gout is uncommon and typically detected only at an **advanced stage**.\n\nThe underlying mechanism involves the body's inability to properly **eliminate uric acid**, resulting in crystal formation.\n\n## How do you get gout in your hand?\n\nGout in the hand develops due to several causes and risk factors. High levels of uric acid in the blood are a primary cause.\n\nThis often results from a diet **rich in purines**, which are found in foods like red **meat** and **seafood**.\n\nOther factors include **genetics**, **obesity**, and certain **health conditions**. These factors increase the risk of developing gout. When uric acid crystals form in the hand joints, they cause the painful symptoms associated with gout.\n\n## What are the symptoms of gout in your hand?\n\nThe symptoms of gout in the hand are often sudden and intense.\n\n- Severe pain in the joints of the hand, [often occurring at night](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/how-to-stop-gout-pain-at-night).\n- Redness, swelling, and tenderness in the affected area.\n- Shiny skin over the joint, which may peel.\n- Limited range of motion in the affected joints.\n\nSymptoms can last from a few days to a few weeks, with symptom-free intervals in between.\n\n## How to treat gout in the hand?\n\n[Treating gout](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/10-minute-gout-relief) in the hand involves several approaches to manage pain and reduce uric acid levels.\n\n- **Resting** the affected hand and applying **ice packs** can help reduce pain and swelling.\n- **Drinking plenty of water** is important to help flush uric acid from the body.\n- Dietary changes, such as **reducing intake of purine-rich foods** like red meat and seafood, can also help.\n- Maintaining a **healthy weight** and avoiding alcohol are beneficial in managing gout.\n- Regular **medical check-ups** and following a doctor's advice are crucial for effective treatment.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
