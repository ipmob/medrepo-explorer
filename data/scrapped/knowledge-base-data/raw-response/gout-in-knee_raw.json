Gout can affect any joint, but it most commonly affects the big toe, [ankles](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/gout-in-ankle), and knees.\n\nThe knee joint is particularly vulnerable because it is a large joint that bears a significant amount of body weight. This makes it a common site for uric acid crystal accumulation.\n\nGout in the knee can significantly impact mobility and daily activities. It can make it challenging to perform simple tasks like walking, climbing stairs, or even sitting comfortably.\n\n## What causes gout in the knee?\n\n[Gout](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/gout-vs-bunion#what-is-gout) is a form of arthritis caused by high levels of [uric acid](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/uric-acid#what-do-abnormal-levels-mean) in the blood. This acid forms sharp crystals in the joints, leading to inflammation and pain. [Gout symptoms can intensify at night](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/how-to-stop-gout-pain-at-night) often disrupting sleep and causing significant discomfort.\n\n**Specific Factors Leading to Gout in the Knee**:\n\n- Accumulation of uric acid crystals in the knee joint.\n- Triggers like dehydration, injury, or sudden changes in uric acid levels.\n\n**Role of Diet and Lifestyle in Causing Knee Gout**:\n\n- High-purine foods (red meat, seafood) increase uric acid levels.\n- Alcohol consumption contributes to higher uric acid levels.\n- Sedentary lifestyle and obesity increase the risk.\n\n**Genetic Predisposition and Other Risk Factors**:\n\n- Genetic makeup can make some people more prone to gout.\n- Higher risk in men, older adults, and those with conditions like hypertension and diabetes.\n\n## What are the symptoms of gout?\n\n- Intense pain in the knee joint.\n- Swelling and stiffness in the knee.\n- Redness and warmth around the knee.\n\n**Additional signs indicating a gout flare-up in the knee**:\n\n- Limited range of motion in the knee.\n- Tenderness in the knee joint.\n- Symptoms can last for days to weeks if untreated.\n\n## How to diagnose knee gout?\n\nDiagnosing knee gout starts with a consultation with a healthcare provider. They will review your medical history and ask about your symptoms.\n\n**1\\. Physical Examination**: During a physical examination, the doctor will check for signs of inflammation, redness, and tenderness in the knee joint. They will also assess your range of motion.\n\n**2\\. Laboratory Tests**:\n\n- Blood tests can measure uric acid levels in your blood.\n- High uric acid levels may suggest gout, but they are not definitive.\n\n**3\\. Joint Fluid Analysis**: A definitive diagnosis often requires a joint fluid analysis. The doctor will extract fluid from the knee joint with a needle and examine it for uric acid crystals under a microscope.\n\n**4\\. Imaging Tests**:\n\n- X-rays, ultrasounds, or MRI scans can help identify joint damage or uric acid crystal deposits.\n- Imaging tests are useful to rule out other conditions with similar symptoms.\n\n**5\\. Final Diagnosis**: Combining the results from the medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, joint fluid analysis, and imaging tests allows the doctor to confirm if you have gout in your knee.\n\n## Treatments for gout in the knee\n\n[**Immediate Relief Measures**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/10-minute-gout-relief): [Treating gout](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/gout-removal) in the knee often starts with measures to relieve pain and reduce inflammation. Resting the affected knee and applying ice packs can help alleviate symptoms.\n\n**Lifestyle Changes**: Drinking plenty of water and maintaining a healthy weight are also important.\n\n**Medication-Free Management**:\n\n- Using supportive devices like knee braces can provide stability and reduce strain on the knee joint.\n- Gentle exercises and physical therapy can improve joint function and flexibility without putting too much stress on the knee.\n\n**Long-Term Management Strategies**:\n\n- Regular monitoring of uric acid levels is essential to prevent flare-ups.\n- Implementing a consistent exercise routine helps maintain joint health and overall well-being.\n\n## Diet Tips\n\nFoods to eat and avoid for managing gout in the knee according to the [Arthritis Foundation](https://www.arthritis.org/health-wellness/treatment/treatment-plan/disease-management/treatments-for-gout):\n\n**1\\. What to eat/drink**:\n\n- Fruits, vegetables and whole grains\n- Non-meat proteins such as low-fat dairy products, beans and lentils\n- Lean meats and poultry\n- Water for hydration\n- Coffee\n- Cherries or cherry juice\n\n**2\\. What to avoid (or consume in moderation)**:\n\n- Foods and drinks containing high-fructose corn syrup\n- Fatty cuts of meat and high-fat dairy products\n- Organ meats, which have high levels of purine\n- Shellfish, anchovies and sardines, all of which are high in purines\n- Alcoholic beverages, including beer — especially during a gout attack\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
