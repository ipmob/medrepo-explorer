These hormones influence the body's **water retention** and can cause the gastrointestinal tract to slow down, leading to feelings of fullness and discomfort.\n\nAs estrogen levels rise, the body tends to retain more water, contributing to bloating.\n\nAdditionally, the decrease in progesterone can lead to **slower digestion**, resulting in gas and bloating.\n\nThis combination of factors is the primary reason for the uncomfortable sensation of bloating during menstruation.\n\n## How long does bloating last during periods?\n\nAccording to the [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3154522/) from Obstetrics and Gynecology International, women typically experience bloating most intensely during the luteal phase of their menstrual cycle, **just before their period begins**.\n\nFor most people, bloating typically subsides by the **third** or **fourth** day of menstruation as hormone levels begin to stabilize.\n\nHowever, the duration of bloating can vary from person to person, depending on individual hormonal responses and other factors like diet and [stress](https://docus.ai/tags/stress).\n\nWhile it's common for bloating to decrease as the period progresses, some may experience lingering symptoms for a few more days.\n\n## How to prevent bloating during menstruation?\n\nTo prevent period bloating, consider these strategies:\n\n- **Limit salty foods**: Reducing salt intake helps prevent water retention, which is a major cause of bloating.\n- **Eat potassium-rich foods**: NIH [notes](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Potassium-HealthProfessional/), that foods like bananas, avocados, and spinach help balance sodium levels and reduce bloating.\n- **Stay active**: Regular exercise, such as walking or yoga, can improve digestion and reduce bloating.\n- **Stay hydrated**: Drinking plenty of water prevents your body from retaining fluids, which can cause bloating.\n- **Manage stress**: Practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation to minimize hormonal fluctuations that lead to bloating.\n\n## How to get rid of period bloating immediately?\n\nFor immediate relief from period bloating, try these tips:\n\n- **Gentle exercise**: Activities like walking or stretching can help stimulate digestion and reduce bloating.\n- **Herbal teas**: Drinking peppermint or ginger tea can soothe your digestive system and ease bloating. According to [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6341159/), ginger can help reduce bloating by speeding up digestion and easing stomach discomfort.\n- **Warm compress**: Applying a warm compress to your abdomen or taking a warm bath can relax muscles and reduce bloating discomfort.\n- **Avoid carbonated drinks**: These can cause you to swallow excess air, which contributes to bloating.\n- **Limit chewing gum**: Chewing gum can also lead to swallowing air, increasing bloating.\n- **Massage abdomen**: Gently massaging the abdomen in a circular motion can help relieve trapped gas and promote bowel movement, reducing bloating.\n- **Drink plenty of water**: Staying hydrated helps flush out excess sodium, which can reduce water retention and bloating.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
