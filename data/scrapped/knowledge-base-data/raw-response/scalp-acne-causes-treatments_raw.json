Hormonal changes, stress, certain medications, and external factors like hair care products can contribute to its development.\n\nTreatment involves specialized shampoos, proper hair care routines, and dietary adjustments.\n\nContents\n\n- [What Causes Scalp Acne?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/scalp-acne-causes-treatments#what-causes-scalp-acne)\n- [Scalp Acne Treatment](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/scalp-acne-causes-treatments#scalp-acne-treatment)\n- [Best Shampoo for Scalp Acne](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/scalp-acne-causes-treatments#best-shampoo-for-scalp-acne)\n- [Baby Acne on Scalp](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/scalp-acne-causes-treatments#baby-acne-on-scalp)\n\n## What Causes Scalp Acne?\n\nScalp acne is the result of a combination of factors similar to those that cause acne in other parts of the body. Here are the primary causes:\n\n1. **Excess Sebum Production**: Sebum is an oily substance that keeps the skin hydrated. Overproduction can clog hair follicles, leading to acne.\n2. **Dead Skin Cells**: The accumulation of dead skin cells on the scalp can further block hair follicles, contributing to acne formation.\n3. **Bacterial Growth**: Propionibacterium acnes, a bacteria that thrives in oily, clogged environments, can cause inflammation and acne outbreaks.\n4. **Hormonal Changes**: Hormonal fluctuations during puberty, pregnancy, or menstrual cycles can increase sebum production, making the scalp more susceptible to acne.\n5. **[Stress](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/causes-and-solutions-for-stress-acne) and Medications**: [AAD](https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/acne/causes/acne-causes) highlights, that while stress does not directly cause acne, it can exacerbate existing acne conditions. Both can disturb hormonal balance and impact skin health.\n6. **External Factors**: Certain hair care products, environmental pollutants, and sweat (especially when hair is covered by hats or helmets) can block pores and trigger acne.\n7. **Genetics**: A family history of acne can make individuals more prone to scalp acne.\n8. **Diet**: Foods high in dairy or with a high glycemic index can influence acne development, though the impact varies among individuals.\n\n## Scalp Acne Treatment\n\nEffective treatment for scalp acne requires addressing both symptoms and underlying causes:\n\n1\\. Specialized Shampoos:\n\n- **Salicylic Acid**: Exfoliates the scalp, removing dead skin cells and sebum that clog follicles.\n- **Ketoconazole**: An antifungal ingredient that reduces inflammation and itchiness.\n\n2\\. Prescription Solutions: For severe cases, dermatologists may prescribe:\n\n- **Topical Antibiotics**: To stop bacterial growth.\n- **Retinoids**: To normalize skin cell production and prevent clogged follicles.\n\n3\\. Hair Care Regimen:\n\n- Use light, non-comedogenic products.\n- Avoid heavy oils and silicones.\n- Regularly clean your hair and scalp, but avoid overwashing.\n\n4\\. Dietary Adjustments:\n\n- Reduce intake of sugars and high-glycemic foods.\n- Include omega-3 fatty acids, zinc, and antioxidants.\n\n5\\. Stress Management: Implement relaxation techniques to control hormonal factors associated with acne.\n\n## Best Shampoo for Scalp Acne\n\nWhen choosing a shampoo for scalp acne, look for formulations that cleanse effectively without aggravating the condition:\n\n1. **Salicylic Acid Shampoos**: Break down the bond between dead skin cells and excess sebum, reducing pore clogging.\n2. **Zinc Pyrithione Shampoos**: Offer antimicrobial and antifungal properties, targeting acne-causing bacteria.\n3. **Tea Tree Oil Shampoos**: Natural antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties make it a great ingredient for combating scalp acne.\n4. **Consider Scalp Type**: Choose formulas free from harsh chemicals like sulfates, parabens, and artificial fragrances. Gentle, non-comedogenic shampoos are ideal for soothing and healing the skin.\n5. **Hypoallergenic Shampoos**: For sensitive scalps, these shampoos minimize allergic reactions and provide safe, effective cleansing.\n\n## Baby Acne on Scalp\n\nBaby acne on the scalp, known as neonatal cephalic pustulosis, appears as small, red bumps. It is usually due to maternal hormones that remain in the baby's system post-birth, stimulating oil glands and leading to acne.\n\nCare Tips:\n\n- **Gentle Cleansing**: Use a mild baby shampoo and lukewarm water, followed by drying with a soft towel.\n- **Avoid Oily Products**: Refrain from applying oily lotions or creams on the affected areas.\n- **Do Not Scrub or Pop**: Avoid scrubbing the bumps or trying to pop them to prevent irritation or infection.\n\nIf baby acne persists or causes **discomfort**, consult a pediatrician or dermatologist for advice on safe and effective treatment options.\n\nHowever, the condition usually resolves on its own within a few weeks to months.\n\nBy understanding and addressing the various factors that cause scalp acne, you can manage and treat this condition effectively, ensuring a healthy scalp and clear skin.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
