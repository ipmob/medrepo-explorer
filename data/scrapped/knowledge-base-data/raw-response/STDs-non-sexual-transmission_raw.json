STDs like herpes, syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia can sometimes be [transmitted through non-sexual means](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/std-without-sex), such as mother-to-child transmission during childbirth or sharing contaminated needles.\n\nUnderstanding these transmission methods is crucial for prevention and awareness.\n\nContents\n\n- [Can you get syphilis without having sex?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/STDs-non-sexual-transmission#can-you-get-syphilis-without-having-sex)\n- [Can you get chlamydia without having sex?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/STDs-non-sexual-transmission#can-you-get-chlamydia-without-having-sex)\n- [Can you get HPV without having sex?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/STDs-non-sexual-transmission#can-you-get-hpv-without-having-sex)\n- [Can you get gonorrhea without sex?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/STDs-non-sexual-transmission#can-you-get-gonorrhea-without-sex)\n- [How is herpes transmitted non-sexually?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/STDs-non-sexual-transmission#how-is-herpes-transmitted-non-sexually)\n\n## Can you get syphilis without having sex?\n\nYes, syphilis can be contracted without direct sexual contact, although this is less common. Syphilis is primarily spread through **direct contact with a syphilis sore** during sexual activity, but non-sexual transmission is still possible.\n\nOne way syphilis can be transmitted without sex is from a pregnant mother to her baby. This occurs when the mother has syphilis and passes it to her child during childbirth. This is known as congenital syphilis (CS) and can have serious health consequences for the newborn.\n\nCDC [notes](https://www.cdc.gov/syphilis/about/about-congenital-syphilis.html#:~:text=Congenital%20syphilis%20(CS)%20occurs%20when,cases%20reported%20in%202022%20alone.) that in recent years, CS cases have tripled, with more than **3,700 cases** reported in 2022.\n\nAnother possible non-sexual transmission route is through **contact with an open syphilis sore or lesion**. If someone has direct contact with a syphilis sore on another person's body, especially in areas like the mouth or genitals, transmission can occur.\n\nHandling infected items, such as contaminated **needles**, is another risk factor, though this is very rare. Understanding these risks can help people take precautions to avoid infection.\n\n## Can you get chlamydia without having sex?\n\nWhile chlamydia is predominantly spread through **sexual contact**, it is possible, though rare, to contract it without engaging in sexual intercourse.\n\nOne non-sexual transmission method is **from mother to child during childbirth**. If a pregnant woman has chlamydia, the infection can be passed to her baby, potentially leading to eye infections or [pneumonia](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/pneumonia) in the newborn.\n\nChlamydia transmission through other non-sexual means, such as [kissing](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/chlamydia-from-kissing), sharing towels, or touching contaminated surfaces, is **extremely unlikely**.\n\nUnlike some other STDs, **chlamydia requires direct mucous membrane contact to spread effectively**. This means that casual contact, such as hugging or shaking hands, does not pose a risk of transmission.\n\nDespite its rarity, understanding the potential for non-sexual transmission of chlamydia is important for pregnant women and healthcare providers to prevent neonatal infections.\n\n**Note from** [**WHO**](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chlamydia): _Consistent and correct use of condoms when having vaginal and anal sex is the only way to prevent chlamydial infection._\n\n## Can you get HPV without having sex?\n\nYes, it is possible to contract human papillomavirus (HPV) without engaging in sexual intercourse.\n\nMany strains of HPV can affect the mouth, throat, or genital area, and they are highly contagious.\n\nTransmission does not require penetrative sex.\n\n**According to the [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/human-papilloma-virus-hpv/#:~:text=Human%20papillomavirus%20(HPV)%20is%20the,more%20than%20100%20different%20types.), someone can contract HPV through**:\n\n- Any skin-to-skin contact in the genital area\n- Vaginal, anal, or oral sex\n- Sharing sex toys\n\nHPV often presents no symptoms, so you might not be aware that you have it.\n\nIt's very common; most people will contract some type of HPV at some point in their lives.\n\nHPV can also be transmitted through shared personal items that have come into contact with the virus. This includes sharing **towels**, **razors**, or **clothing** with someone who has an active infection. The virus can survive on surfaces for a short period, so contact with contaminated objects can occasionally lead to infection.\n\nHowever, these non-sexual transmission routes are less common than sexual transmission. Awareness of these methods can help people take precautions and reduce the risk of contracting HPV.\n\n## Can you get gonorrhea without sex?\n\nGonorrhea is primarily spread through sexual contact, but there are rare instances where it can be contracted without sexual intercourse.\n\nSimilar to chlamydia, one of the main non-sexual transmission methods is from mother to child **during childbirth**, states [Stanford Health](https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-conditions/sexual-and-reproductive-health/gonorrhea/causes.html#:~:text=Gonorrhea%20is%20an%20infection%20caused,it%20on%2C%20even%20without%20symptoms.). If a pregnant woman has gonorrhea, the bacteria can infect her baby during delivery, potentially leading to serious **eye infections** in the newborn.\n\nOutside of childbirth, non-sexual transmission of gonorrhea is **extremely rare**. Casual contact, such as kissing, hugging, or sharing personal items, does not usually spread the infection.\n\nHowever, it’s essential to maintain good hygiene and avoid sharing items that may have been in contact with infected areas. While non-sexual transmission is uncommon, awareness is crucial for preventing transmission to newborns and ensuring proper treatment for infected individuals.\n\n## How is herpes transmitted non-sexually?\n\n[Herpes can be transmitted non-sexually](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/non-sexual-herpes-transmission) through several routes, primarily involving direct contact with the virus.\n\nOne common way is through **skin-to-skin contact** with an infected area. For example, if someone has a cold sore caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV-1), touching the sore and then touching another person's mucous membranes or open skin can lead to transmission. This means that activities like **kissing** can spread oral herpes even if there is no sexual contact.\n\nHerpes can also be transmitted through sharing personal items that have come into contact with the virus. These items might include **towels**, **razors**, or **eating utensils**.\n\nAdditionally, healthcare professionals may spread the virus by touching their mouths, eyes, or other body parts with **contaminated hands or medical instruments**, though strict hygiene practices make this rare.\n\nThe virus can survive on surfaces for a short time, so indirect contact with infected items can occasionally lead to transmission.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
