During the day, activities and interactions can divert attention from pain.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to this increase, including the body's **circadian rhythms**, which affect pain perception. **Lower levels of natural pain-relieving hormones** at night can also make pain more intense.\n\nAt night, without daily distractions, the mind may focus more on the pain, amplifying its perception. **Lower temperatures** can cause muscles and joints to stiffen, increasing pain levels.\n\nMany conditions can worsen pain at night, such as **arthritis**, **fibromyalgia**, **peripheral neuropathy**, [**sciatica**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/immediate-relief-for-sciatica-pain), and **restless leg syndrome**.\n\n**Migraines**, **chronic [back pain](https://docus.ai/tags/back-pain)**, **tendinitis**, **bursitis**, and **[gastroesophageal reflux disease](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/overview-of-gerd)**(GERD) can also become more intense when lying down.\n\n## Leg pain at night\n\n[Leg pain at night](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/understanding-aching-legs-at-night) can be caused by various factors, including:\n\n- **Muscle cramps**: Sudden, involuntary contractions of leg muscles, often due to dehydration, overuse, or electrolyte imbalances.\n- **Poor circulation**: Reduced blood flow to the legs can cause pain, often associated with conditions like peripheral artery disease.\n- **Nerve issues**: Conditions such as neuropathy or sciatica can lead to sharp, burning, or [tingling pain in the legs](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/tingling-in-lower-legs).\n- **Restless leg syndrome**: A condition causing an uncontrollable urge to move the legs, often accompanied by uncomfortable sensations. The Mayo Clinic [states](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/restless-legs-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20377168) that restless leg syndrome can start at any age and typically worsens as one gets older.\n- **Arthritis**: Inflammation of the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and swelling, which can worsen at night due to inactivity.\n\nLeg pain at night can significantly disrupt sleep quality, causing frequent awakenings and difficulty falling asleep. Poor sleep can lead to fatigue and negatively impact overall health.\n\nTo manage leg pain at night, try gentle stretching exercises before bed, using a **pillow to elevate your legs**, and maintaining a comfortable sleep environment. Applying **heat or cold packs** may also help alleviate pain.\n\nIf leg pain at night is severe, persistent, or accompanied by other symptoms like **swelling** or **numbness**, it's important to see a doctor. Professional evaluation can help diagnose underlying conditions and recommend appropriate treatment.\n\nMaking lifestyle changes such as **staying hydrated**, maintaining a **healthy weight**, and engaging in **regular physical activity** can help reduce leg pain at night. Additionally, wearing comfortable shoes and avoiding prolonged periods of sitting or standing may also provide relief.\n\n## Knee Pain at Night\n\nCommon causes of [knee pain](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/comprehensive-guide-to-knee-pain-causes-and-treatments) at night:\n\n- **Osteoarthritis**: Degeneration of joint cartilage leading to pain and stiffness.\n- **Tendonitis**: Inflammation of tendons around the knee due to overuse.\n- **Bursitis**: Inflammation of the bursa, causing swelling and pain.\n- **Injuries**: Ligament tears or meniscus injuries causing knee pain.\n- **Overuse**: Excessive stress on the knee joint during daily activities.\n\nKnee pain can disrupt sleep by causing discomfort when lying down or changing positions. This leads to frequent awakenings and poor sleep quality, which can result in fatigue and decreased daytime function.\n\nManaging knee pain at night involves using **pillows to support and align the knee**, applying **ice or heat packs**, and doing gentle stretches before bed. Maintaining a comfortable sleep environment and avoiding activities that strain the knee can also help.\n\nIt's important to see a doctor if knee pain at night is severe, persistent, or accompanied by **swelling**, **redness**, or **difficulty moving the knee**. A healthcare professional can diagnose the underlying cause and recommend appropriate treatment.\n\nLifestyle changes such as maintaining a **healthy weigh** t, engaging in **low-impact exercises**, and avoiding activities that put excessive stress on the knee can help reduce pain. **Strengthening** the muscles around the knee can also provide support and alleviate pain.\n\n## Shoulder Pain at Night\n\nCommon causes of shoulder pain at night:\n\n- **Rotator cuff injuries**: Tears or inflammation in the rotator cuff causing pain.\n- **Frozen shoulder**: Stiffness and pain due to inflammation of the shoulder capsule.\n- **Bursitis**: Inflammation of the bursa in the shoulder joint causing pain.\n- **Tendonitis**: Inflammation of shoulder tendons from overuse or injury.\n- **Poor sleeping posture**: Sleeping in positions that strain the shoulder.\n\nShoulder pain can make it difficult to find a comfortable sleeping position, leading to frequent awakenings and disrupted sleep. This can result in poor sleep quality and daytime fatigue.\n\nTo [manage shoulder pain at night](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/tips-on-how-to-sleep-with-pain#how-to-sleep-with-shoulder-pain), try using **pillows to support the shoulder** and maintain a comfortable sleeping position. Applying **ice or heat packs**, performing gentle stretches, and avoiding sleeping on the affected shoulder can also help.\n\nConsult a doctor if shoulder pain at night is **severe**, **persistent**, or accompanied by **swelling**, **numbness**, or **weakness**. A medical evaluation can help identify the cause and provide appropriate treatment options.\n\nLifestyle changes such as improving posture, avoiding repetitive overhead activities, and incorporating shoulder-strengthening exercises can help reduce pain. Using ergonomic furniture and taking breaks during activities that strain the shoulder can also be beneficial.\n\n## Pain in Toes at Night\n\nCommon causes of pain in toes at night:\n\n- **Gout**: A form of arthritis causing severe pain in the big toe joint.\n- **Arthritis**: Inflammation of toe joints leading to pain and stiffness.\n- **Bunions**: Bony bumps at the base of the big toe causing pain.\n- **Neuropathy**: Nerve damage leading to burning or tingling pain in the toes.\n- **Poor circulation**: Reduced blood flow to the toes causing discomfort.\n\nToe pain can make it difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep, leading to frequent awakenings and poor sleep quality.

Wearing **comfortable shoes** and using **orthotic inserts** can also help alleviate pain.\n\nIt's important to see a doctor if toe pain at night is severe, persistent, or accompanied by **swelling**, **redness**, or [**numbness**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/understanding-numb-big-toe).
