Managing this condition is crucial to prevent potential complications and ensure overall oral health and comfort.\n\nContents\n\n- [What is a Cyst on Gum?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/gum-cyst#what-is-a-cyst-on-gum)\n- [Gum Cyst Symptoms](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/gum-cyst#gum-cyst-symptoms)\n- [How to Get Rid of Gum Cyst?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/gum-cyst#how-to-get-rid-of-gum-cyst)\n\n## What is a Cyst on Gum?\n\nA gum cyst, also known as a **gingival cyst** or an **oral cyst on the gum**, is a fluid-filled sac that forms on the gums in the mouth.\n\nTypically benign, these cysts appear just below the gum line and can be **caused by various factors**, including:\n\n- infections\n- irritations from foreign bodies\n- developmental abnormalities\n\nGum cysts are relatively common and are usually noticeable as small bumps on the gum tissue.\n\n## Gum Cyst Symptoms\n\nGum cysts, also referred to as dental cysts on the gum, often present several symptoms that can help in their identification, including:\n\n- **Swelling or Bump on the Gum**: A noticeable bulge or protrusion on the gum that may be filled with fluid.\n- **Redness or Tenderness**: The area around the cyst might be [red](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/red-spots-on-gums#causes-of-red-spots-on-gums) and can feel tender or painful to touch, especially when eating or brushing.\n- **Discomfort during Chewing**: As the cyst can be located where the jaw closes, it might cause discomfort or pain while chewing.\n- **Change in Gum Color**: The affected area may have a different color, often appearing bluish or translucent due to the fluid inside the cyst.\n\nThese symptoms can vary in intensity and might not all be present in every case. If you suspect a gum cyst, it is advisable to consult a dental professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\n## How to Get Rid of Gum Cyst?\n\nGum cyst treatment typically involves several approaches, depending on the size, cause, and symptoms of the cyst. Some common treatment options include:\n\n- **Observation**: Small cysts that cause no discomfort may simply be monitored over time to see if they resolve on their own.\n- **Surgical Removal**: For larger or persistent cysts, surgical removal may be necessary. This procedure is typically straightforward and performed under local anesthesia.\n- **Medication**: If the cyst is associated with an infection, antibiotics or other medications may be prescribed to reduce inflammation and clear the infection.\n- **Laser Therapy**: Laser treatment can be an effective option for gum cyst removal. According to a publication by [Colgate](https://www.colgate.com/en-us/oral-health/gum-disease/how-laser-periodontal-therapy-treats-gums-disease), there's less bleeding, pain, and swelling with periodontal laser therapy because it is less invasive than traditional surgery. This method offers a quicker recovery and minimal discomfort.\n- **Drainage**: If the cyst is particularly large or painful, a dentist might drain the fluid from the cyst to relieve symptoms.\n\nIt is important to consult with a dental professional to determine the most appropriate treatment based on the specific characteristics of the gum cyst.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
