Recognizing an asthma [cough](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/effective-drinks-and-food-for-cough) is crucial for managing the condition effectively.\n\n**Characteristics of an asthma cough**:\n\n- Dry and persistent\n- Sounds like a repetitive, non-productive hack\n- Often worsens at night or early morning\n- Triggered by allergens, cold air, or exercise\n\nEarly identification of an asthma cough can help in taking timely action to prevent severe **asthma attacks**.\n\nIf you recognize this cough, consult a healthcare professional for advice on managing asthma symptoms effectively.\n\n## What Does an RSV Cough Sound Like?\n\nAs [noted](https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/rsv/rsv-in-adults) by the American Lung Association, [**RSV**](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/understanding-rsv-rash) (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections.
