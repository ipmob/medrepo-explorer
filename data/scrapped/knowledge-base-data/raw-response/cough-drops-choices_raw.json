Available in various flavors and sugar-free options, they cater to different preferences. When choosing cough drops, it is important to consider ingredients, sugar content, and symptoms.\n\nContents\n\n- [What are Cough Drops?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/cough-drops-choices#what-are-cough-drops)\n- [How to Choose Cough Drops?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/cough-drops-choices#how-to-choose-cough-drops)\n\n## What are Cough Drops?\n\n[Cough drops](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/understanding-cough-drops) are small, medicated candies designed to soothe a sore throat and reduce coughing. They are widely used for temporary relief.\n\nThe primary purpose of cough drops is to **calm the throat** and d **ecrease irritation** that causes coughing. They work by lubricating the throat.\n\nCommon ingredients in cough drops:\n\n- **Honey-based** cough drops are widely recognized for their natural soothing effects. Honey is not only effective in calming irritated throat tissues but also has antimicrobial properties that can help fight against infections. Studies have shown that honey can be as effective as some over-the-counter cough medicines in reducing cough symptoms, making it a preferred choice for those seeking natural remedies.\n- **Menthol** cough drops offer immediate relief by creating a cooling sensation that can ease the discomfort of a sore throat and reduce the urge to cough. Menthol, derived from peppermint oil, acts as a mild anesthetic, soothing the throat by numbing the area slightly. This makes menthol cough drops a popular choice for quick relief, especially in environments where dry air can exacerbate throat irritation.\n- **Herbal** cough drops incorporate a variety of natural ingredients such as echinacea, ginger, elderberry, and sometimes even licorice root. These herbs have been used traditionally to support immune function and offer anti-inflammatory benefits, providing a more holistic approach to treating coughs. For instance, echinacea is known for its immune-boosting properties, while ginger can help ease nausea and reduce inflammation.\n- **Pectin-based** cough drops utilize pectin, a soluble fiber found in fruits, to form a protective coating over the throat. This barrier can help shield irritated mucous membranes from further irritation, reducing the urge to cough. Pectin is also gentle on the stomach, making these cough drops a suitable option for those with sensitive digestive systems.\n\n## How to Choose Cough Drops?\n\nSelecting the right cough drops is essential for effective relief. Different cough drops serve different needs and preferences.\n\nWhen choosing cough drops, consider the ingredients. Look for **natural components** if you prefer them. Also, check for **sugar content** if you need to avoid sugar.\n\nSome cough drops are better for mild throat irritation, while others are designed for more severe symptoms. Read the label to find the best match for your needs.\n\nFor the best results, choose cough drops that fit your specific situation. Consult with a healthcare provider if you are unsure which type is right for you.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
