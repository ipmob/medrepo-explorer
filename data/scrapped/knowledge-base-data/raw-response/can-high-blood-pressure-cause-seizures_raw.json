This may lead to **neurological symptoms, including seizures**.\n\nUncontrolled high blood pressure also increases the risk of **stroke**, which can **damage brain tissue and trigger seizures**.\n\n## How are these seizures different from epilepsy?\n\nEpilepsy is a **chronic neurological disorder** where seizures happen due to **abnormal electrical activity in the brain**.\n\nSeizures caused by **high blood pressure** are different because:\n\n- They occur **due to extreme hypertension**, not irregular brain signals.\n- They are **temporary** and usually stop once blood pressure is lowered.\n- They do **not mean a person has epilepsy** but still require medical attention.\n\nIf someone with high blood pressure has a seizure, they should **see a doctor immediately** to rule out serious complications.\n\n## What are the symptoms of a seizure from high blood pressure?\n\nA seizure caused by high blood pressure often happens when the condition reaches a **crisis level**. Before a seizure, a person may show warning signs such as:\n\n- **Severe headache** that doesn’t go away\n- **Blurred or double vision**\n- **Confusion or trouble thinking**\n- **Nausea or vomiting**\n- **Shortness of breath**\n- **Sudden loss of consciousness**\n\nIf you or someone you know has **high blood pressure and these symptoms**, **seek emergency medical care immediately**.\n\nIgnoring these signs can lead to life-threatening complications.\n\n## Who is at risk of high blood pressure-related seizures?\n\nNot everyone with high blood pressure is at risk of seizures.\n\nHowever, certain people are more vulnerable, including:\n\n- **People with uncontrolled hypertension** – Chronic high blood pressure increases the risk of complications.\n- **Those in a hypertensive crisis** – Blood pressure above **180/120 mmHg** can cause brain swelling and seizures.\n- **Individuals with kidney disease** – The kidneys help control blood pressure, and damage to them can worsen hypertension.\n- **Stroke survivors** – A past stroke can make the brain more sensitive to sudden blood pressure changes.\n- **Pregnant women with preeclampsia or eclampsia** – These conditions cause **dangerously high blood pressure and seizures**.\n- **People with epilepsy** – While epilepsy and high blood pressure seizures are different, some [research](https://aepi.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42494-024-00152-9) suggests **hypertension can make seizure control harder**.\n\nIf you are at risk, **monitor your blood pressure regularly** and follow medical advice to prevent dangerous spikes.\n\n## What to do if someone has a seizure due to high blood pressure?\n\nSeizures can be alarming, but staying calm and taking quick action can make all the difference. Here’s what to do:\n\n1. **Call 911 or emergency services immediately** – This is a life-threatening situation.\n2. **Lay the person on their side** – This helps prevent choking if they vomit.\n3. **Do not put anything in their mouth** – Contrary to popular belief, people do not swallow their tongues during seizures. Inserting objects can cause injury.\n4. **Do not try to hold them down** – Let the seizure run its course. Restraining them can cause harm.\n5. **Check their breathing** – If they stop breathing after the seizure, start **CPR** until medical help arrives.\n6. **Stay with them** – After the seizure, they may be confused. Keep them calm and reassure them until medical professionals take over.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
