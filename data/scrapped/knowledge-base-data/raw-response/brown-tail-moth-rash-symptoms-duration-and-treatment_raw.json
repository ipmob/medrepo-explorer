The rash typically develops when these tiny, barbed **hairs embed into the skin**, leading to an allergic reaction, according to the [NPS](https://www.nps.gov/articles/browntail-moth-in-acadia.htm).\n\nThis reaction results in **red**, **itchy bump** s that can form clusters and spread across the affected area. The rash is common in areas exposed to the caterpillar's hairs, such as the **arms**, **neck**, and **face**.\n\nThe severity of the rash can vary, with some individuals experiencing mild irritation and others suffering from intense itching and inflammation.\n\n**Causes**\n\n- **Contact with caterpillar hairs**: The primary cause is direct contact with the brown tail moth caterpillar's toxic hairs.\n- **Airborne hairs**: The hairs can become airborne and cause a rash when they land on the skin.\n- **Contaminated clothing or surfaces**: Touching clothing, bedding, or surfaces contaminated with the caterpillar's hairs can also lead to the rash.\n- **Seasonal activity**: The risk of developing the rash is higher during late spring and summer when the caterpillars are most active.\n\n## What Does Brown-Tail Moth Rash Look Like?\n\nBrown tail moth rash looks like **small, red bumps on the skin**. These bumps may form clusters and spread.\n\nThe rash is often **itchy** and can become **inflamed**. It may also develop into a blistering condition if scratched.\n\nLook for raised, red bumps that are itchy and in clusters. The rash typically appears on **exposed skin areas**.\n\n## Symptoms of Brown-Tail Moth Rash\n\n**Initial symptoms**\n\n- Tingling or burning sensation on the skin\n- Red bumps appearing shortly after contact\n\nAs the rash progresses, the itching can become **more intense**. The rash area may also swell and become more irritated. The rash can cause significant itching and discomfort. Scratching may lead to further irritation and potential skin infections.\n\n## How Long Does Brown-Tail Moth Rash Last?\n\nThe duration of a brown tail moth rash can vary depending on the severity of the reaction and the individual's skin sensitivity. Typically, the rash lasts for a **few days to a couple of weeks**. In most cases, the intense itching and redness subside **within a week**.\n\nHowever, if the rash is severe or if there has been extensive contact with the caterpillar hairs, the symptoms might persist for **up to two weeks**. Proper care and avoiding further exposure to the hairs can help shorten the duration of the rash.\n\n## How to Treat Brown-Tail Moth Rash?\n\n[Treating](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/rash-treatment-at-home) brown tail moth rash involves a combination of relieving symptoms and preventing further irritation. Here are some steps to manage the rash:\n\n- **Clean the affected area**: Gently wash the skin with soap and water to remove any remaining caterpillar hairs.\n- **Avoid scratching**: Scratching can worsen the rash and lead to infections. Keep nails short to minimize damage.\n- **Cool compresses**: Applying cool, wet compresses can help reduce itching and swelling.\n- **Moisturize**: Use gentle moisturizers to soothe dry and irritated skin.\n- **Avoid further exposure**: Stay away from areas where brown-tail moth caterpillars are present, and wear protective clothing when necessary.\n- **Consult a healthcare professional**: If the rash is severe or persists, seek medical advice for additional treatment options.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
