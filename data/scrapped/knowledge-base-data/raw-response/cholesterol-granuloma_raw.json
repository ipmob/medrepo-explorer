If untreated, it may result in severe complications such as hearing loss, nerve damage, and bone destruction. Early recognition of this condition is crucial for timely treatment.\n\nContents\n\n- [What is Cholesterol Granuloma?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/cholesterol-granuloma#what-is-cholesterol-granuloma)\n- [What Causes Cholesterol Granuloma?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/cholesterol-granuloma#what-causes-cholesterol-granuloma)\n- [Cholesterol Granuloma Symptoms](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/cholesterol-granuloma#cholesterol-granuloma-symptoms)\n- [Cholesterol Granuloma Diagnostics](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/cholesterol-granuloma#cholesterol-granuloma-diagnostics)\n- [Cholesterol Granuloma Treatment](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/cholesterol-granuloma#cholesterol-granuloma-treatment)\n\n## What is Cholesterol Granuloma?\n\nCholesterol granuloma is a **type of cyst** that forms when [cholesterol](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/cholesterol) deposits accumulate. These cysts often appear in the **middle ear** or **petrous apex**. They contain cholesterol crystals, fluid, and other debris, surrounded by an inflammatory response.\n\nThis condition can lead to a variety of symptoms, impacting the affected area significantly. It is **non-cancerous** but can cause discomfort and other complications.\n\n## What Causes Cholesterol Granuloma?\n\nCholesterol granuloma forms due to **chronic inflammation** and **blockage in the ear or sinus areas**. The blockage prevents normal drainage, leading to fluid accumulation.\n\nOver time, cholesterol crystals and other materials build up, triggering an inflammatory response. This process results in the formation of a granuloma.\n\n**Chronic ear infections**, **trauma**, or **previous surgeries** can increase the risk of developing this condition.\n\nHealthline [notes](https://www.healthline.com/health/cholesterol/cholesterol-granuloma-symptoms#the-cholesterol-connection) that cholesterol granulomas seem more common in families with familial **hypercholesterolemia**, though a proven link is lacking.\n\n## Cholesterol Granuloma Symptoms\n\nCholesterol granuloma can cause various symptoms depending on its location. Common symptoms include:\n\n- **Hearing loss**: Occurs due to the cyst pressing on ear structures.\n- **The feeling of fullness or pressure in the ear**: Caused by the accumulation of fluid.\n- [**Dizziness**](https://docus.ai/tags/dizziness) **or balance problems**: Arise if the granuloma affects the inner ear.\n- **Tinnitus (ringing in the ears)**: A frequent symptom experienced by patients.\n- **Facial pain or paralysis**: May occur if the granuloma impacts nearby nerves.\n\nAccording to [UPMC](https://www.upmc.com/services/neurosurgery/brain/conditions/brain-tumors/cholesterol-granuloma), if not treated and the mass keeps growing, cholesterol granulomas of the petrous apex can lead to **permanent hearing loss**, **nerve damage**, and **bone destruction**.\n\n## Cholesterol Granuloma Diagnostics\n\nDiagnosing cholesterol granuloma involves several steps, including:\n\n- **Medical history and physical examination**: Initial assessment by a healthcare provider.\n- **Imaging studies**: MRI or CT scans to visualize the cyst and surrounding structures.\n- **Hearing tests**: Assessing the impact on hearing function.\n- **Biopsy**: In some cases, a sample may be taken to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n## Cholesterol Granuloma Treatment\n\nTreatment for cholesterol granuloma often involves various approaches, including:\n\n- **Surgical intervention**: Removal of the cyst to alleviate symptoms and prevent recurrence.\n- **Draining the cyst**: Procedure to improve drainage pathways and reduce fluid buildup.\n- **Non-surgical options**: Managing symptoms with decongestants or therapies to reduce inflammation and promote drainage.\n\nRegular follow-up is important to monitor for any recurrence or complications.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
