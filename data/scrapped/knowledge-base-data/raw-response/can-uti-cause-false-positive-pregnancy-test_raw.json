It's essential to understand the reasons behind any unexpected test results.\n\nContents\n\n- [Can a UTI Cause a False Positive Pregnancy Test?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/can-uti-cause-false-positive-pregnancy-test#can-a-uti-cause-a-false-positive-pregnancy-test)\n- [Can a UTI Medicine Cause a False Positive Pregnancy Test?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/can-uti-cause-false-positive-pregnancy-test#can-a-uti-medicine-cause-a-false-positive-pregnancy-test)\n\n## Can a UTI Cause a False Positive Pregnancy Test?\n\nA urinary tract infection (UTI) cannot directly cause a false positive pregnancy test. Pregnancy tests work by detecting the hormone hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) in your urine, which is produced during pregnancy. A UTI does not affect this hormone, so it shouldn't change the results.\n\nHowever, there are a few scenarios where a UTI might indirectly lead to confusion:\n\n1. **Contaminated Urine Sample**: If the urine sample is contaminated with blood, bacteria, or white blood cells due to the UTI, it might make the test difficult to read, though this usually doesn’t result in a false positive.\n2. **Misinterpretation**: Symptoms of a UTI, such as frequent urination, might be confused with early pregnancy symptoms, leading to unnecessary testing or misinterpretation of results.\n\nIf there’s any doubt, it’s best to retake the test or consult a healthcare provider for further evaluation.\n\n## Can a UTI Medicine Cause a False Positive Pregnancy Test?\n\nUTI medications, such as antibiotics commonly prescribed for urinary tract infections, do not cause a false positive pregnancy test. Pregnancy tests work by detecting the hormone hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) in urine or blood, and UTI medications do not interfere with the production or detection of this hormone.\n\nAccording to [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/false-positive-pregnancy-test#medications), certain medications containing hCG are used to stimulate ovulation, which can influence the results of a pregnancy test. However, these medications are not prescribed for treating urinary tract infections (UTIs).\n\nIf you get a positive result on a pregnancy test while taking UTI medication and you’re unsure of the result, it’s advisable to:\n\n1. **Retake the Test**: Consider taking another test a few days later to confirm the result.\n2. **Consult a Healthcare Provider**: If there's any confusion, your healthcare provider can perform a more accurate test or provide guidance based on your situation.\n\nIn summary, UTI medications should not cause a false positive pregnancy test.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
