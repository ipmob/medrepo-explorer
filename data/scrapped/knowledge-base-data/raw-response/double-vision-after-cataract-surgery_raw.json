Most cases resolve on their own, but treatments and eye exercises can help speed up recovery.\n\nContents\n\n- [What Causes Double Vision after Cataract Surgery?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/double-vision-after-cataract-surgery#what-causes-double-vision-after-cataract-surgery)\n- [Will Double Vision after Cataract Surgery Go Away?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/double-vision-after-cataract-surgery#will-double-vision-after-cataract-surgery-go-away)\n- [Treatment for Double Vision after Cataract Surgery](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/double-vision-after-cataract-surgery#treatment-for-double-vision-after-cataract-surgery)\n- [Eye exercises for double vision after cataract surgery](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/double-vision-after-cataract-surgery#eye-exercises-for-double-vision-after-cataract-surgery)\n\n## What Causes Double Vision after Cataract Surgery?\n\nAccording to an NCBI [publication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7812090/), cataract extraction is the most common surgical procedure across all medical specialties, with approximately **3.7 million cases** annually in the USA.\n\nDouble vision after cataract surgery can happen for a few reasons:\n\n- The eye muscles might be slightly out of alignment after the surgery.\n- The eye may still need a minor vision correction even after the cataract is removed.\n- Swelling or inflammation in the eye after surgery can temporarily cause double vision.\n- Existing conditions like strabismus or other eye muscle issues might cause double vision after surgery.\n\n## Will Double Vision after Cataract Surgery Go Away?\n\nIn many cases, double vision after cataract surgery will **go away on its own**.\n\nThe recovery time varies from person to person, but many individuals see improvement **within a few days to weeks**.\n\nFactors that can affect the recovery include the **overall health of the eye**, any **pre-existing conditions**, and the exact cause of the double vision.\n\nRegular follow-up visits with your eye doctor are essential to monitor the healing process and address any persistent issues.\n\n## Treatment for Double Vision after Cataract Surgery\n\nTreatment for double vision after cataract surgery depends on the underlying cause:\n\n- If inflammation or swelling is causing the problem, **anti-inflammatory treatments** or **rest** might be recommended.\n- For refractive errors, **glasses** or **contact lenses** can help correct the vision.\n- **Eye muscle exercises** might be suggested to improve muscle coordination.\n- For more persistent or severe cases, further **surgical intervention** may be considered to align the eye muscles properly.\n\n## Eye exercises for double vision after cataract surgery\n\nEye exercises can be beneficial in managing double vision after cataract surgery. These exercises aim to strengthen and coordinate the eye muscles. Here are a few effective exercises:\n\n1\\. **Focusing on a moving object**:\n\n- Duration: 5 minutes per session\n- Frequency: 3 times daily\n- Instructions: Hold a pen or similar object at arm's length. Move it slowly side to side and up and down. Follow the object with your eyes while keeping your head still.\n\n2\\. **Pencil push-ups**:\n\n- Duration: 5 minutes per session\n- Frequency: 3 times daily\n- Instructions: Hold a pencil at arm's length and slowly bring it towards your nose. Keep the pencil in focus as you move it closer. Repeat several times.\n\n3\\. **Convergence exercises**:\n\n- Duration: 5 minutes per session\n- Frequency: 3 times daily\n- Instructions: Focus on a distant object, then shift your focus to a closer object. Alternate between focusing on near and far objects to improve eye coordination.\n\n4\\. **Eye tracking**:\n\n- Duration: 5 minutes per session\n- Frequency: 3 times daily\n- Instructions: Move your eyes in different directions (left, right, up, down) without moving your head. This helps strengthen the eye muscles and improves their coordination.\n\nRegularly practicing these exercises can help improve muscle function and reduce double vision.\n\nAlways consult with your eye doctor before starting any exercise regimen to ensure they are appropriate for your specific condition.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
