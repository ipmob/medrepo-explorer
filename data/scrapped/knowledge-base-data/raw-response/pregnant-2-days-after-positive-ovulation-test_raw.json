The fertile window includes the LH surge day and two days after, making this the best time for conception.\n\nContents\n\n- [How Do Ovulation Tests Work?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/pregnant-2-days-after-positive-ovulation-test#how-do-ovulation-tests-work)\n- [Can I Get Pregnant 2 Days After a Positive Ovulation Test?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/pregnant-2-days-after-positive-ovulation-test#can-i-get-pregnant-2-days-after-a-positive-ovulation-test)\n\n## How Do Ovulation Tests Work?\n\n[Ovulation](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/ovulation) is the process where an egg is released from the ovary. That is when the egg is available for fertilization.\n\nIn a perfect 28-day cycle, ovulation typically happens on the **14th day**(counting from the first day of menstruation). However, cycles can vary, and ovulation may occur earlier or later depending on the individual’s cycle length.\n\nTo track ovulation, you can use [ovulation tests](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/ovulation-test-strips), which help identify your most fertile days.\n\nThese tests work by detecting the **luteinizing hormone (LH)** in your urine. LH surges just before ovulation, signaling that the egg is about to be released.\n\nWhen you see a positive result on the test, it means your LH levels have spiked, and ovulation is likely to occur within **12–36 hours**.\n\nA [**positive test**](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/decoding-positive-ovulation-test) shows you're in your fertile window (the time when conception is most likely), the best time for conception. A **[negative test](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/negative-ovulation-test)** means no LH surge yet, so keep testing daily.\n\n**Note:** _Ovulation tests have a_ [_97%_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5689497/) _accuracy rate._\n\nHowever, _conditions like_ [_PCOS_](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/pcos-overview) _or hormonal imbalances can cause false positives or negatives. Wrong time or diluted urine may also affect accuracy._\n\n_You can confirm ovulation using other methods, like tracking basal body temperature, monitoring cervical mucus, or consulting a doctor for ultrasound monitoring_\n\n## Can I Get Pregnant 2 Days After a Positive Ovulation Test?\n\nThe short answer is yes, you can get pregnant two days after a positive ovulation test.\n\nYour fertile window begins a few days before ovulation and lasts up to 24 hours after the egg is released.\n\nThe most fertile time is the day of the [LH surge](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/lh-surge) (when you get a positive ovulation test) and the two days that follow. After this, fertility drops significantly, as the egg remains viable for only 24 hours.\n\nFor clarity, let's break it down:\n\n- A positive ovulation test means the LH surge has begun. This marks the start of your fertile window. Ovulation typically occurs within **12 to 36 hours** after the surge.\n- During ovulation, the ovary releases an egg.\n- Once released, the egg has a lifespan of about **12 to 24 hours**. If it isn’t fertilized during this time, the egg disintegrates and is absorbed by the body.\n\nRemember, sperm can stay alive in the reproductive tract for several days (up to 5).\n\nHaving intercourse from a few days before ovulation and through the day of ovulation can significantly increase your chances of conception.\n\n**Note:** _Intercourse during the fertile window increases the likelihood of pregnancy, but it doesn’t guarantee it. Factors like egg and sperm quality, overall reproductive health, and timing can all influence the outcome_\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
