Treatment](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/chronic-pyelonephritis#chronic-pyelonephritis-treatment)\n\n## What is Chronic Pyelonephritis?\n\nChronic pyelonephritis is a **long-term kidney infection** that can cause **permanent kidney damage**.\n\nIt **results from repeated kidney infections** or **persistent [infections](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/bladder-infection-vs-uti)**.\n\nUnlike acute pyelonephritis, which is a sudden and severe infection, chronic pyelonephritis develops slowly over time.\n\nAccording to the Cleveland Clinic [data](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15456-kidney-infection-pyelonephritis), about **1 in 2,000** people in the U.S. get a kidney infection each year, which can progress to chronic pyelonephritis if not properly treated.\n\nThis condition often occurs in individuals with **urinary tract obstructions** or **vesicoureteral reflux**, where urine flows backward from the bladder to the kidneys.\n\nEarly detection and management are crucial to prevent serious complications.\n\n## Chronic Obstructive Pyelonephritis\n\nChronic obstructive pyelonephritis occurs when long-term kidney infection is accompanied by an **obstruction in the urinary tract**.\n\nThis obstruction can be due to conditions like **[kidney stones](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/what-can-mimic-kidney-stone-pain)**, **tumors**, or **congenital abnormalities**.\n\nUnlike non-obstructive pyelonephritis, the obstructive form leads to increased pressure in the kidneys, further damaging the renal tissue.\n\nThis condition significantly impacts kidney function and increases the risk of **chronic kidney disease**.\n\nEarly detection and removal of the obstruction are essential for managing this condition.\n\n## Chronic Pyelonephritis Symptoms\n\nSymptoms of chronic pyelonephritis can vary but often include:\n\n- Persistent back or flank pain\n- [Fever](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/when-to-go-to-the-hospital-for-fever) and chills\n- [Frequent urination](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/frequent-urination-before-period-causes-and-management)\n- Strong urge to urinate\n- Painful urination\n- Fatigue\n- [Nausea](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/cases-of-long-lasting-nausea)\n- Weight loss\n\nIf left untreated, chronic pyelonephritis can lead to severe complications like **kidney failure** or **high blood pressure**.\n\nRecognizing symptoms early and seeking medical attention is important for managing this condition effectively.\n\n## Diagnosis of Chronic Pyelonephritis\n\nDiagnosing chronic pyelonephritis involves several steps:\n\n1. **Clinical evaluation**: Includes a detailed medical history and physical examination.\n2. **Urinalysis**: Detects infections and assesses urine composition.\n3. **Blood tests**: Evaluate kidney function and overall health.\n4. **Imaging studies**: Ultrasounds or CT scans visualize kidney structure and identify abnormalities.\n5. **Renal biopsy**: In some cases, confirms the diagnosis by examining kidney tissue.\n\nEarly diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and preventing further kidney damage.\n\n## Chronic Pyelonephritis Treatment\n\nTreatment for chronic pyelonephritis involves [managing the infection](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/get-rid-of-uti-in-24-hours) and addressing any underlying causes.\n\nGeneral treatment approaches include **prolonged use of antibiotics** to clear the infection.\n\nLifestyle changes, such as **increasing fluid intake** and **maintaining good hygiene**, are recommended.\n\nDietary adjustments, like **reducing salt** and **protein intake**, can help support kidney health.\n\nLong-term management includes regular follow-up appointments and monitoring kidney function to prevent complications.\n\nEarly and consistent treatment is key to managing chronic pyelonephritis effectively.\n\n![AI
