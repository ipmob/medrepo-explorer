Understanding how to not pass out when getting blood drawn involves simple yet effective strategies like proper preparation, staying hydrated, and managing anxiety.\n\nContents\n\n- [How to Not Pass Out When Getting Blood Drawn?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/avoid-fainting-blood-draw#how-to-not-pass-out-when-getting-blood-drawn)\n- [What to Eat Before a Blood Test to Avoid Fainting?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/avoid-fainting-blood-draw#what-to-eat-before-a-blood-test-to-avoid-fainting)\n\n## How to Not Pass Out When Getting Blood Drawn?\n\nTo avoid passing out during a [blood test](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview), it’s essential to manage your [anxiety](https://docus.ai/tags/anxiety) and physical reactions. Start by taking deep, slow breaths before and during the procedure. This helps calm your nervous system and reduces the chance of fainting.\n\n- **Distract yourself** during the blood draw by looking away or engaging in a conversation. Focus on something other than the needle to keep your mind off the procedure.\n- **Tensing your muscles**, especially in your legs, can also help. According to the American Psychological Association ( [APA](https://dictionary.apa.org/applied-tension)), applied tension is a behavioral therapy technique that helps prevent fainting by tensing and relaxing muscles to counteract low blood pressure during anxiety-inducing situations. This technique increases blood flow to your brain and reduces the likelihood of fainting.\n\n**Note**: _If you know you have a history of fainting, inform the healthcare provider beforehand. They may suggest lying down during the procedure to reduce the risk._\n\n## What to Eat Before a Blood Test to Avoid Fainting?\n\nEating the right foods before a blood test can help you avoid fainting during the procedure. To stabilize your blood [glucose](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/glucose) levels, make sure to **have a light meal** or snack **a few hours before** your appointment. Avoid eating too much, as a full stomach can make you feel queasy during the blood draw.\n\n- Opt for foods rich in **complex carbohydrates** and **proteins**, such as whole grains, fruits, and lean meats. These foods provide a steady release of energy, which helps maintain your blood sugar levels.\n- **Avoid sugary snacks and drinks**, as they can cause a spike and then a drop in blood sugar, leading to lightheadedness.\n- [Hydration](https://docus.ai/tags/hydration) is also important. Dehydration can make it harder to draw blood and increase the chances of feeling faint. **Drink plenty of water** before your test, but avoid caffeinated beverages, as they can increase anxiety and lead to dehydration.\n\n**Note**: _There are times when you must take the blood test without eating anything. These are typically fasting blood tests, which require you to avoid food for 8-12 hours before the test, as stated in_ [_WebMD_](https://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/fasting-blood-tests) _. In such cases, focus on staying hydrated and follow other strategies to manage your anxiety during the blood draw._\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
