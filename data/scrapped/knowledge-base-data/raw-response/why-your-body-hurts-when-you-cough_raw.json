This [pain can occur in various parts of the body](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/why-it-hurts-when-you-cough), including the back, side, ribs, shoulder, temples, and uterus. Identifying the cause is crucial for effective treatment and relief.\n\nContents\n\n- [My Temple Hurts When I Cough](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/why-your-body-hurts-when-you-cough#my-temple-hurts-when-i-cough)\n- [My Shoulder Hurts When I Cough](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/why-your-body-hurts-when-you-cough#my-shoulder-hurts-when-i-cough)\n- [My Rib Hurts When I Cough](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/why-your-body-hurts-when-you-cough#my-rib-hurts-when-i-cough)\n- [My Side Hurts When I Cough](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/why-your-body-hurts-when-you-cough#my-side-hurts-when-i-cough)\n- [My Back Hurts When I Cough](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/why-your-body-hurts-when-you-cough#my-back-hurts-when-i-cough)\n- [My Uterus Hurts When I Cough](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/why-your-body-hurts-when-you-cough#my-uterus-hurts-when-i-cough)\n\n## My Temple Hurts When I Cough\n\n[Pain in the temple](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/identify-headache-types-by-location#temples-headache) when coughing is a less common complaint but can be particularly distressing. It may be related to **tension** headaches, where the muscles around the skull and neck become tight, causing pain that can be exacerbated by coughing.\n\n**Sinus issues**, notably affecting **28.9 million** adults, or **11.6% of the adult population**, as per CDC [publication](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/sinuses.htm), are another potential cause, as congestion and inflammation within the sinus cavities can lead to increased pressure and pain in the temples.\n\n**Management Techniques:**\n\n- Address the headache or sinusitis with appropriate medications, such as decongestants for sinus relief or pain relievers for headaches.\n- Stay hydrated and use humidifiers to keep nasal passages moist.\n- Practice relaxation techniques to ease muscle tension.\n- Seek medical evaluation if temple pain is severe, recurrent, or accompanied by other symptoms like visual disturbances or nausea to rule out more serious conditions like migraines or temporal arteritis.\n\n## My Shoulder Hurts When I Cough\n\nShoulder pain associated with coughing can arise from several sources, including referred pain from a **lung** or **diaphragm** issue or direct strain on shoulder muscles.\n\nReferred pain occurs when a problem in one part of the body causes pain in another area, such as a **lung infection** or **pleurisy** causing shoulder discomfort. Direct strain, on the other hand, may result from the overuse of shoulder muscles during prolonged coughing episodes.\n\n**Relief Measures:**\n\n- Rest, ice, or heat application, and gentle stretching exercises can help alleviate muscle strain.\n- Treat the underlying condition, such as using antibiotics for an infection.\n- Use pain relievers to manage discomfort.\n- Consult a healthcare provider if shoulder pain persists or is accompanied by difficulty breathing or fever to rule out serious conditions.\n\n## My Rib Hurts When I Cough\n\nRib pain when coughing is often associated with conditions like **costochondritis**, **rib fractures**, or **muscle strains**. **Costochondritis** involves inflammation of the cartilage that connects the ribs to the breastbone, causing sharp pain in the chest, which can be mistaken for a heart attack.\n\nRib fractures or cracks, resulting from severe coughing spells or injury, lead to intense pain and require medical evaluation and rest for healing. Muscle strains around the rib cage are also a frequent cause of pain due to the overuse of chest and upper body muscles during persistent coughing.\n\n**Treatment Options:**\n\n- Rest and avoid activities that worsen the pain.\n- Use medications for pain management.\n- Apply heat or cold packs for temporary relief.\n- Seek immediate medical care if breathing becomes difficult or pain is severe to prevent complications.\n\n## My Side Hurts When I Cough\n\nPain on the side when coughing could indicate several conditions, including **pleurisy**, which is the inflammation of the pleura lining the lungs and chest cavity. This condition can cause sharp, stabbing pain that worsens with breathing and coughing.\n\nOther possible causes include **rib injuries** or **intercostal muscle strains**, which can occur after excessive coughing or due to direct trauma. **Respiratory infections** that lead to coughing can also cause side pain due to the constant strain on the muscles and tissues in the chest and abdomen.\n\n**Management Strategies:**\n\n- Rest and minimize activities that exacerbate the cough.\n- Use NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) to reduce inflammation.\n- Gentle stretching and breathing exercises can help ease the pain and improve lung function.\n- Seek medical attention if pain persists or is severe to rule out serious conditions like pneumonia or pneumothorax (collapsed lung).\n\n## My Back Hurts When I Cough\n\n[Back pain during coughing](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/alleviating-upper-back-pain) often indicates an underlying **muscle strain**. The back muscles support much of the body's weight and are involved in various movements, including coughing. When these muscles are strained or weakened, the added pressure from coughing can cause pain.\n\nThis pain is usually felt as a sharp sensation or a dull ache in the **lower or upper back**. Conditions like **herniated discs**, where the cushioning between spinal vertebrae is damaged, can also lead to back pain when coughing by irritating nearby nerves.\n\n**Relief Tips:**\n\n- Apply heat or cold packs to the affected area to reduce inflammation and soothe muscle strain.\n- Over-the-counter pain relief medication can be effective.\n- Strengthening exercises for the back and core, under the guidance of a healthcare professional, can help prevent recurring pain.\n\n## My Uterus Hurts When I Cough\n\n[Uterine pain](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/stabbing-pain-in-pelvic-area-in-females) when coughing can indicate underlying gynecological conditions, such as [endometriosis](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/adenomyosis-vs-endometriosis-symptoms-causes-and-more#understanding-adenomyosis-and-endometriosis), where tissue similar to the uterine lining grows outside the uterus, causing pain and inflammation.\n\nPelvic inflammatory disease (PID), an infection of the female reproductive organs, can also cause pain in the uterus that worsens with coughing. Uterine [fibroids](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/which-size-of-fibroid-is-dangerous), benign tumors in the uterus, can create a sensation of pressure or pain in the pelvic area.\n\n**Treatment Approaches:**\n\n- Anti-inflammatory medications, hormonal therapies, or surgery in severe cases.\n- Pelvic floor physical therapy to strengthen the muscles in the pelvic area, potentially reducing pain.\n- Consult a healthcare provider for a thorough evaluation and appropriate treatment if experiencing persistent or severe uterine pain, especially if accompanied by other symptoms like abnormal bleeding or fever.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
