This results in breathing difficulties, which can vary in severity. ​​Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America [reports](https://aafa.org/asthma/asthma-facts/) that over **27 million people in the U.S. have asthma**.\n\nCommon symptoms of asthma include:\n\n- Wheezing\n- Shortness of breath\n- Chest tightness\n- Coughing, especially at night or early morning\n\nAsthma can be triggered by various factors such as **allergens**, **exercise**, **cold air**, and **respiratory infections**.\n\n## What is COVID-19?\n\nCOVID-19 is an [**infectious disease**](https://docus.ai/tags/infectious-diseases) caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. It primarily spreads through **respiratory droplets** when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks.\n\nCommon symptoms of COVID-19 include:\n\n- [Fever](https://docus.ai/tags/fever)\n- [Cough](https://docus.ai/tags/cough)\n- Shortness of breath\n- [Fatigue](https://docus.ai/tags/fatigue)\n- Loss of taste or smell\n\nWhile most people recover from COVID-19 without needing special treatment, some develop severe illness, particularly older adults and those with underlying health conditions.\n\nLong-term complications can occur, including respiratory issues and other health problems.\n\n## Why Does Asthma Often Get Worse After COVID-19?\n\nAsthma often gets worse after COVID-19 due to the **inflammatory response** triggered by the virus. COVID-19 can cause extensive inflammation in the lungs and airways, leading to **increased sensitivity** and **reactivity** in individuals with asthma.\n\nThe [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/asthma/respiratory-infections/index.html#:~:text=If%20you%20have%20asthma%2C%20take%20steps%20to%20prevent%20getting%20COVID,same%20time%20as%20other%20vaccines.) advises individuals with asthma to take precautions to avoid contracting COVID-19, as the infection can trigger an asthma attack.\n\nAdditionally, the recovery process from COVID-19 can **weaken the respiratory system**, making it more susceptible to irritants and allergens. This can further aggravate asthma symptoms.\n\nLong-term lung damage caused by severe COVID-19 can also play a role in worsening asthma, making it essential for individuals to:\n\n- Follow their asthma management plan closely\n- Seek medical advice for any changes in their symptoms\n\n## Can You Develop Asthma After COVID-19?\n\nYes, it is possible to develop asthma after having COVID-19. The virus can cause significant **inflammation in the respiratory system**, leading to asthma symptoms. This is especially true for individuals who have severe COVID-19 or pre-existing respiratory conditions.\n\nThe Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America [notes](https://aafa.org/asthma/asthma-triggers-causes/respiratory-infections-flu-cold-asthma/#:~:text=Respiratory%20infections%20are%20a%20common,harder%20for%20them%20to%20breathe.&text=You%20can%20have%20more%20than%20one%20respiratory%20infection%20at%20the%20same%20time.) that respiratory infections frequently trigger asthma, particularly in children. COVID-19, being a severe respiratory virus, has been observed to cause long-term lung complications in some patients.\n\nIf you notice respiratory symptoms persisting long after recovering from COVID-19, it is important to consult a healthcare provider to determine if you have developed asthma.\n\n## How is Asthma Diagnosed?\n\nDiagnosing asthma after recovering from COVID-19 involves several key steps by healthcare providers:\n\n- **Medical History and Symptom Review**: Providers will ask about your medical history, including any previous respiratory conditions, and review symptoms like wheezing, shortness of breath, and persistent coughing.\n- **Physical Examination**: This includes listening to lung sounds and checking for respiratory distress to detect any abnormalities.\n- **Spirometry Test**: Measures the amount and speed of air you can inhale and exhale, helping to identify airflow obstruction, which is a key indicator of asthma.\n- **Peak Flow Measurement**: Uses a peak flow meter to measure how well your lungs expel air. Lower than normal readings can indicate asthma and help track asthma control over time.\n- **Methacholine Challenge Test**: If spirometry results are inconclusive, this test involves inhaling methacholine, which causes the airways to narrow. People with asthma will react to even small amounts of methacholine, confirming the diagnosis.\n- **Allergy Testing**: Identifies potential triggers if allergic asthma is suspected. This helps in managing and avoiding allergens that could worsen asthma symptoms.\n- **Imaging Tests**: Chest X-rays or CT scans rule out other conditions that could cause similar symptoms, such as infections or structural abnormalities in the lungs.\n\nEarly diagnosis and appropriate management are crucial for controlling symptoms and preventing complications.\n\n## How to Treat Asthma After COVID-19?\n\nAsthma after recovering from COVID-19 can be treated and managed with a combination of medications and lifestyle changes. Common treatments include:\n\n- **Inhaled corticosteroids**: Reduce inflammation in the airways\n- **Bronchodilators**: Relax the muscles around the airways, making it easier to breathe\n\nIt's important to follow your healthcare provider's instructions on how to use these medications correctly.\n\nIn addition to medication, lifestyle changes can help manage asthma symptoms:\n\n- Avoid known triggers, such as allergens and smoke\n- Engage in regular exercise\n- Maintain a healthy diet\n- Keep a clean living environment\n- Practicing good respiratory hygiene (e.g., frequent handwashing)\n- Wearing masks in crowded places\n\nMonitoring your symptoms and having a clear asthma action plan can help you respond quickly to worsening symptoms and prevent severe attacks.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
