Both serve the primary purpose of [birth control](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/birth-control-options) but function differently.\n\n**How They Work**: IUDs are small devices placed inside the **uterus** to prevent sperm from fertilizing an egg. Birth control pills contain **hormones** that prevent ovulation, which stops the release of an egg.\n\n**[Types](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/iud-vs-implant#in-depth-the-intrauterine-device-iud) Available**: IUDs come in hormonal and non-hormonal types. **Hormonal** IUDs release hormones, while **non-hormonal** IUDs use copper to prevent pregnancy. Birth control pills are available in combination pills, containing both estrogen and progestin, and progestin-only pills.\n\n**Usage**: An IUD is inserted by a healthcare provider and can remain effective for several years. Birth control pills must be taken daily at the same time to be effective.\n\n## Pill vs IUD: Effectiveness\n\nEffectiveness is a crucial factor when choosing a birth control method.

IUDs eliminate user error, while pills require strict adherence to **daily intake**. User error can significantly decrease the effectiveness of birth control pills.\n\n## IUD vs Pill: Side Effects\n\nUnderstanding the side effects of birth control methods is important for making an informed choice.

Hormonal IUDs may reduce menstrual bleeding over time. Long-term use of birth control pills may increase the risk of certain health conditions, like **blood clots** and **high blood pressure**.\n\n## IUD vs Pill: Pros\n\nUnderstanding the benefits of each birth control method helps in making an informed choice. Both IUDs and pills have unique advantages.\n\nPros of IUD:\n\n- **Longevity and Convenience**: IUDs are long-lasting and can remain effective for several years without needing replacement.\n- **High Effectiveness**: They offer high effectiveness, with a success rate of over 99%.\n- **Minimal Daily Maintenance**: IUDs require minimal daily maintenance once inserted.\n- **Non-Hormonal Options Available**: Non-hormonal IUDs provide an option for those who prefer to avoid hormones.\n- **Cost-Effectiveness Over Time**: Over time, IUDs are cost-effective despite their higher initial cost.\n\nPros of Birth Control Pills:\n\n- **Regulates Menstrual Cycles**: Birth control pills help regulate menstrual cycles, making periods more predictable.\n- **Reduces Menstrual Cramps and Acne**: They can also reduce menstrual cramps and improve acne.\n- **Flexible and Easily Reversible**: Pills are flexible and can be stopped easily if you want to conceive.\n- **Protection Against Certain Health Issues**: They may offer protection against certain health issues, like ovarian cysts.\n- **Wide Availability and Variety of Options**: Pills are widely available and come in various formulations to suit different needs.\n\n## IUD vs Pill: Cons\n\nKnowing the drawbacks of each birth control method is crucial for making a balanced decision.
