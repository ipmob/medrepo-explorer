It is estimated that about **176 million** women worldwide have endometriosis, according to the [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/endometriosis).\n\nAn endometriosis flare-up is a **sudden increase in symptoms** caused by the growth of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus. This tissue reacts to hormonal changes, causing pain, inflammation, and other symptoms.\n\nFlare-ups can significantly impact individuals with endometriosis, leading to **severe pain**, **fatigue**, and **disruption of daily activities**. This can affect physical, emotional, and social well-being, making routine tasks difficult and reducing quality of life.\n\n## What causes an endometriosis flare-up?\n\nUnderlying Factors:\n\n- **Hormonal Changes**: Fluctuations in estrogen levels, especially during the menstrual cycle, can lead to increased growth and activity of endometrial-like tissue.\n- **Menstrual Cycle**: The shedding of the uterine lining during menstruation can trigger inflammation in areas affected by endometriosis, leading to heightened symptoms.\n\nExternal Triggers:\n\n- **Lifestyle Factors**: Lack of exercise, poor sleep, and high-stress levels can cause flare-ups. Physical and emotional stress can increase inflammation and hormonal imbalances.\n- **Diet and Stress**: Certain foods can trigger inflammation, and chronic stress can worsen symptoms. Managing diet and stress through healthy habits and relaxation techniques can help reduce the frequency and severity of flare-ups.\n\n**Duration and frequency**:\n\nThe frequency and duration of endometriosis flare-ups can vary greatly among individuals. Some flare-ups may last a **few hours**, while others can persist for **several days or even weeks**.\n\nSome people may experience flare-ups **monthly**, often coinciding with their menstrual cycle. Others may have flare-ups less frequently, such as a **few times a year**, depending on the factors listed above.\n\n## Endometriosis flare-up symptoms\n\n- [**Pelvic Pain**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/stabbing-pain-in-pelvic-area-in-females): Persistent or severe pain in the pelvic region, often worse during menstruation. Around **70%** of adolescents with chronic pelvic pain have endometriosis, as per Obstetrics and Gynecology [data](https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/aogs.12121).\n- **Cramps**: Painful cramps that can occur before and during periods.\n- [**Back Pain**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/endometriosis-back-pain): Lower back pain that can radiate to the legs.\n- [**Fatigue**](https://docus.ai/tags/fatigue): Extreme tiredness that can interfere with daily activities.\n- **Bowel and Bladder Issues**: Painful bowel movements or urination, especially during periods.\n- [**Heavy Menstrual Bleeding**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/8-types-of-abnormal-menstruation): Unusually heavy or prolonged menstrual periods.\n\nThese symptoms can vary in intensity and duration, making each flare-up unique for different individuals.\n\n## How to treat endometriosis flare-ups?\n\nLifestyle Changes:\n\n- **Healthy Diet**: Eating anti-inflammatory foods can help reduce symptoms.\n- **Regular Exercise**: Gentle exercise can help alleviate pain and improve overall well-being.\n- **Stress Management**: Techniques such as yoga, meditation, and deep breathing can help manage stress levels.\n\nHome Remedies:\n\n- **Heat Therapy**: Applying a heating pad to the pelvic area can help reduce pain.\n- **Warm Baths**: Taking warm baths can relax muscles and alleviate discomfort.\n\nProfessional Treatments:\n\n- **Physical Therapy**: Specialized physical therapy can help manage pain and improve function.\n- **Counseling**: Talking to a therapist can help manage the emotional impact of endometriosis.\n\nIncorporating [endometriosis self-care practices](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/endometriosis-self-care) such as maintaining a healthy diet, regular exercise, and stress management can help reduce the frequency and severity of flare-ups.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
