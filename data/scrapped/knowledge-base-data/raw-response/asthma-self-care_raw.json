Always take your prescribed medications as directed, as they control airway inflammation and keep symptoms in check. Missing doses can increase your risk of asthma attacks, so consistency is key.\n\nAlong with medication, making lifestyle changes can significantly improve your asthma management. Asthma self-care includes reducing triggers, creating a safe home environment, and adopting a healthy lifestyle. Here are some effective tips to help you manage your asthma.\n\nContents\n\n- [Reduce Common Asthma Triggers](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/asthma-self-care#reduce-common-asthma-triggers)\n- [Create an Asthma-Friendly Environment](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/asthma-self-care#create-an-asthma-friendly-environment)\n- [Adopt a Healthy Lifestyle](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/asthma-self-care#adopt-a-healthy-lifestyle)\n\n## Reduce Common Asthma Triggers\n\n[Asthma](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/asthma) symptoms can be triggered by elements in your environment. Reducing these triggers can help prevent flare-ups:\n\n- **Control Dust and Dust Mites:** Reduce [allergy](https://docus.ai/tags/allergy) triggers by dusting with a damp cloth, vacuuming weekly with a HEPA-filter vacuum, and washing bedding in hot water frequently. Use natural, fragrance-free cleaning products to avoid irritants. Also, use dust-proof covers on mattresses and pillows. Removing carpets, especially in bedrooms, can also help.\n- **Avoid Smoke and Air Pollution:** According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips/diseases/secondhand-smoke-asthma.html), tobacco smoke, including secondhand smoke, is a significant asthma trigger and poses serious health risks, particularly for those with asthma. Ensure your home is smoke-free, use kitchen exhaust fans, and monitor outdoor air quality. On days with poor air quality, keep windows closed and use air purifiers.\n\n## Create an Asthma-Friendly Environment\n\nMaintaining a clean and controlled home environment is essential for managing asthma:\n\n- **Purify the Air:** As [reported](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/air-purifier-for-asthma) by MedicalNewsToday, experts advise choosing an air purifier suitable for the room's size and equipped with a HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filter for best results.\n- **Control Humidity:** Keep humidity levels between 30% and 50% to prevent mold and dust mites. Use a dehumidifier or humidifier as needed and promptly fix leaks.\n\n## Adopt a Healthy Lifestyle\n\nA healthy lifestyle supports better asthma management through simple daily habits:\n\n- **Eat a Balanced Diet:** Avoid food triggers like sulfites and focus on anti-inflammatory foods like fruits, vegetables, and omega-3 fatty acids. Maintaining a healthy weight can reduce lung strain.\n- **Stay Hydrated:** Drink plenty of water to keep mucus thin and easier to clear. Include water-rich foods in your diet, and avoid dehydrating beverages like caffeine and alcohol.\n- **Exercise Safely:** Engage in moderate activities like walking or swimming. Warm up before exercising and avoid outdoor exercise on days with poor air quality.\n- **Manage** [**Stress**](https://docus.ai/tags/stress) **:** Stress can worsen asthma, so practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga. Ensure adequate sleep to support overall health and reduce stress.\n\nThese self-care tips can help you manage asthma more effectively, leading to fewer symptoms and a better quality of life.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
