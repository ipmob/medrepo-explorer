According to an [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4046588/) study, 67-88% of chronic pain patients experience sleep issues, and over 50% of individuals with insomnia also suffer from chronic pain. Ideal sleep positions, supportive pillows, and relaxation techniques can significantly improve sleep quality.\n\nContents\n\n- [How to Sleep with Shoulder Pain on Both Sides?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/understanding-how-to-sleep-with-pain#how-to-sleep-with-shoulder-pain-on-both-sides)\n- [How to Sleep with Rhomboid Pain?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/understanding-how-to-sleep-with-pain#how-to-sleep-with-rhomboid-pain)\n- [How to Sleep with SI Joint Pain?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/understanding-how-to-sleep-with-pain#how-to-sleep-with-si-joint-pain)\n- [How to Sleep with Hip Pain?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/understanding-how-to-sleep-with-pain#how-to-sleep-with-hip-pain)\n- [How to Sleep with Femoral Nerve Pain?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/understanding-how-to-sleep-with-pain#how-to-sleep-with-femoral-nerve-pain)\n\n## How to Sleep with Shoulder Pain on Both Sides?\n\nSuffering from [shoulder pain](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/relief-for-shoulder-pain-when-sleeping-tips-and-treatments) on both sides can significantly disrupt your sleep routine, making it a challenge to find a comfortable position for a restful night.\n\nThis discomfort might stem from various conditions, such as **bursitis**, **tendonitis**, or **rotator cuff injuries**.\n\n**Sleeping on your back with arms at your sides** can minimize shoulder strain. If you prefer sleeping on your side, keep your arms slightly in front and avoid resting directly on your shoulder.\n\nUse a **pillow** that cradles your head without tilting it up or down too much. A **body pillow** can support proper spine alignment and reduce pressure on your shoulders.\n\n## How to Sleep with Rhomboid Pain?\n\n**Rhomboid muscles**, located between your shoulder blades, play a vital role in the movement and support of your upper back and shoulders.\n\nWhen these muscles are strained or injured, they can cause sharp, intense pain, particularly noticeable when you move your arms or twist your upper body.\n\nAvoid sleeping directly on your back if this increases rhomboid pain. Instead, sleep **on your side in the fetal position with a pillow between your knees** to keep your hips aligned and reduce pressure on your back.\n\n**Gentle stretches before sleep** can help relax your rhomboid muscles. Yoga poses like **Child's Pose** can also help release tension.\n\nMake sure your pillow keeps your neck aligned with your spine, and consider using a rolled towel under your mid-back for extra support.\n\n## How to Sleep with SI Joint Pain?\n\n**Sleeping on your back with a pillow under your knees** can help maintain the natural curvature of your spine and reduce pressure on the [sacroiliac (SI) joints](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/si-joint-pain-pregnancy). Alternatively, **sleeping on your side with a pillow between your knees** can keep your hips aligned and minimize pain.\n\nA **medium-firm mattress** is ideal for SI joint pain as it provides both support and comfort. It helps to maintain spinal alignment while reducing pressure on sensitive areas.\n\nA **memory foam pillow under your lower back** or **hips** can provide targeted support. Adjustable bed frames may also help you find a comfortable sleeping angle that reduces stress on your SI joints.\n\n## How to Sleep with Hip Pain?\n\n[Hip pain](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/solutions-for-hip-and-leg-pain), whether stemming from conditions such as arthritis, [bursitis](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/achilles-bursitis), or injuries, can be a significant barrier to achieving a restful night's sleep.\n\n**Sleeping on your back with a pillow under your knees** can align your spine and ease hip pressure. Alternatively, **lying on your side with a pillow between your knees** can help keep your hips level.\n\nA **body pillow** can provide extra support while lying on your side. For back sleepers, placing a pillow or cushion under your knees can reduce stress on the hips.\n\nA **medium-firm mattress** typically provides a balance of comfort and support. Adjustable beds can also help by elevating your upper body or legs to relieve hip pain.\n\n## How to Sleep with Femoral Nerve Pain?\n\n**Sleeping on your back with a pillow under your knees** can help reduce strain on the femoral nerve. Alternatively, try lying on the opposite side of your pain with your hips and knees only slightly bent. Place a thick pillow between your legs to keep your spine aligned and prevent additional pressure.\n\n**Gentle stretches before bedtime** can release tight muscles that may be compressing the femoral nerve. Deep breathing exercises help relieve tension.\n\nA **memory foam cushion** can support your lower back. Also, use a **supportive pillow** to maintain proper spine alignment and avoid aggravating the femoral nerve.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
