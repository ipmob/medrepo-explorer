However, according to a PubMed [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29535234/), the amount of menthol in cough drops may negatively affect cough severity in some individuals.\n- **Eucalyptus Oil**: Helps to reduce inflammation and clear nasal congestion.\n- **Honey**: Included for its soothing properties and natural sweetness, which can coat and calm the throat.\n- **Flavors**: Various flavors are added to make the drops pleasant to take.\n- **Herbal Extracts and Vitamins**: Each chosen for their potential to support throat health and provide a pleasant taste.\n\n## How Long Do Cough Drops Last?\n\nThe relief from cough drops generally lasts for about **2 to 4 hours**.\n\nThis duration can vary depending on several factors:\n\n- **The severity** of throat irritation.\n- **The presence** and **concentration** of active ingredients like menthol or eucalyptus oil.\n- **How slowly** the drop is dissolved in the mouth.\n\nFor persistent symptoms, it may be necessary to use cough drops more frequently, as directed on the packaging.\n\n## How Many Cough Drops Can You Take?\n\nIt is important to follow the instructions on the packaging for the recommended daily limit of cough drops.\n\nTypically, you should not exceed **10 to 12 cough drops per day**. Exceeding this limit can lead to potential risks such as **digestive issues** or an **overdose** of certain ingredients like menthol.\n\nAlways read the label carefully and consult a healthcare professional if you are unsure about the proper dosage.\n\n## Can You Have Cough Drops When Pregnant?\n\nMany cough drops are considered safe to use during pregnancy, but it is important to be cautious. Some ingredients in cough drops, like **menthol** or certain **herbal extracts**, may **not be recommended** for pregnant women.\n\nIt is best to consult your healthcare provider before using cough drops while pregnant. Your doctor can provide advice tailored to your specific situation and ensure the safety of both you and your baby.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
