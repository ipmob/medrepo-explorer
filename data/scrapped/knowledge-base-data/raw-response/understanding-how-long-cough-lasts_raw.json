This type of cough is usually dry and can be quite persistent.\n\nThe duration of an allergy cough depends on how long you're exposed to the [allergen](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/allergy-attack).\n\nOnce you're no longer in contact with the allergen, the cough should go away **within a few days**.\n\n**Factors influencing duration**:\n\n- Continuous exposure to the allergen\n- Severity of your allergy\n- Steps taken to avoid allergens\n\nIf your allergy cough lasts for several weeks or comes with other severe symptoms, it's important to see a healthcare professional.\n\n## How Long Does a Dry Cough Last?\n\nA dry cough is one that doesn't produce mucus and is often caused by **irritants**, [**viral infections**](https://docus.ai/tags/viral-infections), or certain medical conditions, such as **asthma** or [**acid reflux**](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/acid-reflux-cough).\n\nTypically, a dry cough lasts **about three weeks**. If it's due to a viral infection, it should get better on its own.\n\n**Factors influencing duration**:\n\n- Exposure to irritants\n- Underlying health issues\n- Overall health\n\nIf your dry cough sticks around for **more than three weeks** or comes with symptoms like chest pain or trouble breathing, it's a good idea to consult a healthcare professional.\n\n## How Long Does a Wet Cough Last?\n\nA wet cough, also known as a **productive cough**, produces mucus or [**phlegm**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/about-phlegm-after-eating). It is often caused by infections, such as the common **cold** or **bronchitis**.\n\nA wet cough typically lasts for **about three weeks**. If it's caused by an infection, it should improve as the infection clears.\n\n**Factors influencing duration**:\n\n- Severity of the infection\n- Presence of underlying conditions, such as chronic bronchitis or pneumonia\n- Overall health and immune system strength\n\nIf a wet cough persists for **more than three weeks** or is accompanied by symptoms like high fever, shortness of breath, or blood in the mucus, it's important to see a healthcare professional.\n\n## How Long Does a Croup cough Last?\n\nA [croup cough](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/what-your-cough-sound-says-about-your-health#what-does-a-croup-cough-sound-like) is characterized by a distinctive **barking** sound and is caused by a **viral infection** that inflames the windpipe, larynx, and bronchi.\n\nThis condition is common in young children, and according to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8277-croup), it affects about **3%** of U.S. children annually.\n\nA croup cough usually lasts for about three to seven days. The worst symptoms typically occur during the first two to three days.\n\n**Factors influencing duration**:\n\n- Severity of the viral infection\n- Age and overall health of the child\n- How quickly treatment is started\n\nIf the croup cough is severe, causes breathing difficulties, or lasts **more than a week**, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
