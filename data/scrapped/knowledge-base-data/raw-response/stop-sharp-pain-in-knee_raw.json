Initial management includes rest, ice, compression, and strengthening exercises, but persistent pain requires professional evaluation for targeted treatment.\n\nContents\n\n- [Sharp Pain in the Knee When Walking](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/stop-sharp-pain-in-knee#sharp-pain-in-the-knee-when-walking)\n- [Sharp Pain in the Knee When Kneeling](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/stop-sharp-pain-in-knee#sharp-pain-in-the-knee-when-kneeling)\n- [Sharp Stabbing Pain in the Knee Comes and Goes](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/stop-sharp-pain-in-knee#sharp-stabbing-pain-in-the-knee-comes-and-goes)\n\n## Sharp Pain in the Knee When Walking\n\nExperiencing sharp [pain in the knee](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/comprehensive-guide-to-knee-pain-causes-and-treatments) while walking is a common issue that often indicates an underlying problem needing attention.\n\nSeveral potential causes can lead to this type of pain:\n\n: **1\\. Overuse Injuries (Tendonitis)**\n\n- **Description**: Tendonitis is the inflammation of the tendons connecting muscles to bones, resulting from repetitive stress or sudden increases in physical activity.\n- **Symptoms**: Sharp, localized pain that worsens with movement.\n- **Cause**: Repetitive stress or sudden increase in physical activity.\n\n**2\\.** [**Meniscal Tear**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/what-does-a-torn-meniscus-look-like-on-the-outside):\n\n- **Description**: The [meniscus](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/how-to-heal-torn-meniscus-naturally) is a piece of cartilage that cushions between the femur (thigh bone) and tibia (shin bone). It can tear due to direct impact or sudden twists. According to a study published by [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9484571/), the prevalence of meniscal tears is around **12% to 14%**, with an incidence of approximately **61 cases per 100,000 people**.\n- **Symptoms**: Pain, swelling, and limited range of motion, making walking difficult.\n- **Cause**: Direct impact or sudden twist.\n\n**3\\. Knee Bursitis**:\n\n- **Description**: Bursitis involves inflammation of the bursae, small fluid-filled sacs that cushion the knee joint.\n- **Symptoms**: Sharp, localized pain that intensifies with activity.\n- **Cause**: Repetitive motions or prolonged pressure on the knee.\n\nInitial Management:\n\n- **Rest**: Avoid activities that worsen the pain.\n- **Ice**: Apply ice to the knee to reduce inflammation.\n- **Over-the-Counter Pain Relief**: Use medication as needed to manage pain.\n\nProfessional Medical Care:\n\n- **When to Seek Help**: Persistent or severe pain should prompt a visit to a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis.\n- **Physical Therapy**: Strengthen the muscles around the knee and improve stability.\n- **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical intervention may be necessary.\n\n## Sharp Pain in the Knee When Kneeling\n\nSharp [pain in the knee](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/knee-pain-when-squatting) while kneeling is a common issue that can significantly impact daily activities, especially those involving [bending](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/knee-pain-when-bending) or applying direct pressure on the knees.\n\nSeveral conditions can cause this type of discomfort:\n\n**1\\. Prepatellar Bursitis (\"Housemaid's Knee\")**:\n\n- **Description**: Inflammation of the bursa located in front of the kneecap, typically caused by prolonged or frequent kneeling.\n- **Symptoms**: Sharp, localized pain that worsens with pressure on the knee.\n- **Cause**: Prolonged or frequent kneeling.\n\n**2\\. Chondromalacia Patella**:\n\n- **Description**: Softening and deterioration of the cartilage underneath the kneecap.\n- **Symptoms**: Pain and discomfort during activities that stress the knee, such as kneeling or climbing stairs.\n- **Cause**: Stress on the knee joint.\n\nProtective Measures:\n\n- **Knee Pads**: Use during activities that require kneeling to provide cushioning and reduce direct pressure on the knees.\n- **Strengthening Exercises**: Engage in exercises aimed at strengthening the [muscles](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/knee-muscle-spasm) around the knee, particularly the quadriceps, to help stabilize the kneecap and reduce stress on the knee joint.\n\nImmediate Relief:\n\n- **Ice Application**: Apply ice to the affected area after activities that provoke knee pain to reduce inflammation and provide temporary relief.\n\nPersistent or severe knee pain should prompt a medical evaluation for a comprehensive diagnosis. A healthcare professional can recommend a tailored treatment plan based on the specific condition, which may include:\n\n- **Physical Therapy**: Improve knee function and strength.\n- **Medication**: Manage inflammation and pain.\n- **Surgical Interventions**: In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to repair or remove damaged tissue and alleviate the underlying issue.\n\n## Sharp Stabbing Pain in the Knee Comes and Goes\n\nIntermittent sharp stabbing pain in the knee, varying in intensity and frequency, can be a significant source of frustration and discomfort, affecting daily activities. This type of pain can indicate various knee issues, each with specific challenges and treatment requirements.\n\nCommon causes include:\n\n**1\\. Loose Bodies within the Joint**:\n\n- **Description**: Fragments of bone or cartilage that have broken off and float within the joint space.\n- **Symptoms**: Pain occurs when these fragments interfere with knee movement.\n- **Cause**: Injury or degenerative conditions.\n\n**2\\. Ligament Injuries**:\n\n- **Description**: Overstretching or tearing of the knee ligaments.\n- **Symptoms**: Instability and sharp pain, especially during physical activity.\n- **Cause**: Trauma or overuse.\n\n**3\\. Patellar Tendinopathy**:\n\n- **Description**: Inflammation and degeneration of the tendon connecting the kneecap to the shinbone.\n- **Symptoms**: Pain below the kneecap, exacerbated by movement.\n- **Cause**: Overuse or repetitive stress.\n\n**Management includes**:\n\n1\\. RICE Protocol:\n\n- **Rest**: Avoid activities that trigger pain to allow the knee to heal.\n- **Ice**: Apply ice to numb the area and reduce swelling.\n- **Compression**: Use a bandage to support the knee and minimize swelling.\n- **Elevation**: Elevate the leg to promote fluid drainage away from the knee, reducing inflammation.\n\n2. Strengthening and Rehabilitation\n\n- Engaging in exercises to strengthen the muscles around the knee can improve stability and functionality, potentially reducing the frequency and severity of pain episodes. Focus on exercises that target the quadriceps, hamstrings, and calf muscles.\n\n3. Tailored Treatment Plan\n\n- **Physical Therapy**: To rehabilitate the knee and enhance muscle strength.\n- **Medication**: To manage pain and inflammation.\n- **Surgical Interventions**: In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to remove loose bodies, repair ligament damage, or address other structural issues within the knee.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
