Although it commonly affects the big toe, gout can also occur in the heel. The heel is susceptible to gout because it is a weight-bearing joint, and uric acid crystals can easily accumulate there, causing pain and inflammation.\n\n## What is gout in the heel of the foot?\n\n[Gout](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/gout-vs-bunion#what-is-gout) in the heel is a type of **arthritis** where **uric acid crystals** accumulate in the heel joint.

Currently, an estimated **3.9%** of U.S. adults are affected by this condition, according to the National Kidney Foundation [data](https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/gout/patient-facts).\n\n[Uric acid](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/uric-acid) is a waste product that normally **dissolves in the blood** and is excreted in the urine. However, when there is too much uric acid in the body, it can form sharp crystals in joints like the heel, leading to gout.\n\n## What are the symptoms of gout in the heel?\n\n- Intense pain\n- Swelling\n- Redness\n- Warmth in the affected area\n- [Difficulty walking](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/managing-pain-when-walking)\n- Stiffness\n- Limited range of motion\n\n## What causes gout in the heel?\n\n- **Buildup of uric acid crystals in the heel joint**: Excess uric acid forms sharp crystals in the heel.\n- **Diet rich in purines**: Foods like red meat, seafood, and alcohol increase uric acid levels.\n- **Genetic predisposition**: Family history can increase the likelihood of developing gout.\n- **Obesity**: Extra body weight raises uric acid levels in the blood.\n- **Certain medical conditions**: Conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes can lead to higher uric acid levels.\n\n## What does gout feel like in your heel?\n\nGout in the heel feels like an **intense** and **sharp pain**.

This pain may worsen with movement and can make it **difficult to walk or stand**. The affected area may also feel tender and warm to the touch.\n\n## How to relieve gout pain in the heel?\n\n- **Lifestyle changes**: Adopt a diet low in purines, avoid alcohol, and stay well-hydrated to manage uric acid levels.\n- **Rest and elevation**: Rest the affected heel and elevate it to reduce swelling and pain.\n- **Applying ice**: Apply ice packs to the heel for 15-20 minutes several times a day to alleviate pain and reduce inflammation.\n- **Avoiding triggers**: Identify and avoid foods, drinks, or activities that trigger gout flare-ups.\n- **Maintaining a healthy weight**: Losing excess weight can help reduce the risk of gout attacks.\n- **Staying active**: Gentle exercise can improve joint health, but avoid activities that stress the affected heel.\n- **Using protective footwear**: Wear comfortable, supportive shoes to reduce pressure on the heel.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
