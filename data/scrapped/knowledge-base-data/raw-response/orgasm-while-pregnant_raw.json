Many women continue to experience orgasms throughout their pregnancy. Hormonal changes can even enhance sexual pleasure for some women, making orgasms more intense or frequent.\n\n**Increased blood flow to the genitals** and **heightened sensitivity** can contribute to a more pleasurable experience. However, each woman's experience is unique, and some may find their sexual desire fluctuates due to physical and emotional changes.\n\nIt's important to listen to your body and communicate with your partner about your comfort and desires. Maintaining open communication can help ensure a positive sexual experience during pregnancy.\n\n## Is it safe to orgasm while pregnant?\n\nAccording to the [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/sex/#:~:text=If%20your%20pregnancy%20is%20normal,of%20your%20womb%20go%20hard.), if your pregnancy is **healthy** and **free of complications**, having sex and orgasms does not increase the risk of premature labor or miscarriage.\n\nOrgasm can be beneficial, helping to relieve [stress](https://docus.ai/tags/stress) and promote relaxation.\n\nAccording to an American Pregnancy Association [publication](https://americanpregnancy.org/healthy-pregnancy/is-it-safe/sex-and-pregnancy/), there are certain situations where your healthcare provider may **advise against sex or orgasms**, including:\n\n- A history of premature birth or labor\n- A history of miscarriage\n- If your water has broken\n- Unexplained vaginal bleeding or discharge\n- Placenta previa or a very low-lying placenta\n- An incompetent cervix or if it has started to dilate\n- If you or your partner have an [STI](https://docus.ai/tags/sti)\n\nIt's important to communicate with your doctor about any concerns you have regarding sexual activity during pregnancy.\n\n## Why does the uterus get hard when pregnant and having an orgasm?\n\nThe uterus gets hard when pregnant and having an orgasm due to uterine contractions. These contractions are normal and result from the release of hormones like **oxytocin** during sexual climax.\n\nThey are generally harmless and temporary, often **lasting only a few minutes**. These contractions are generally harmless and temporary, often lasting only a few minutes.\n\nThey can be mistaken for **Braxton Hicks** contractions, which are common during pregnancy. According to [StatPearls](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532927/), Braxton Hicks contractions occur sporadically, are irregular in duration, frequency, and intensity, and are more uncomfortable than painful.\n\nIf you experience **pain**, **bleeding**, or have concerns about the frequency or intensity of these contractions, consult your healthcare provider for guidance.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
