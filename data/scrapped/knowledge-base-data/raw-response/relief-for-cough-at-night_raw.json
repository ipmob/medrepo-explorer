Common causes include asthma, [GERD](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/gerd-cough-unveiled), and respiratory infections.\n\nEffective strategies, such as optimizing sleeping positions, using a humidifier, and managing underlying conditions, can significantly alleviate symptoms and lead to more restful nights.\n\nContents\n\n- [What to Do for a Baby with a Cough at Night?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/relief-for-cough-at-night#what-to-do-for-a-baby-with-a-cough-at-night)\n- [How to Stop an Asthma Cough at Night?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/relief-for-cough-at-night#how-to-stop-an-asthma-cough-at-night)\n- [Wheezing Cough at Night](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/relief-for-cough-at-night#wheezing-cough-at-night)\n- [How to Sleep with a Cough?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/relief-for-cough-at-night#how-to-sleep-with-a-cough)\n\n## What to Do for a Baby with a Cough at Night?\n\nCaring for a baby with a cough at night requires gentle, safe interventions to soothe their symptoms and help them (and you) get a better night's sleep.\n\n- **Humidifier**: A cool-mist humidifier can add moisture to the air, relieving coughing by moistening the baby's airway passages. This is particularly helpful for dry or croupy coughs.\n- **Saline Nasal Drops**: Administer a few drops in each nostril to help loosen mucus, making it easier for the baby to breathe and reducing coughing caused by postnasal drip. Follow with gentle suction using a bulb syringe, but use this method sparingly to avoid irritating the baby's nasal passages.\n- **Honey**: For babies over one-year-old, a small amount of honey before bedtime can coat and soothe the throat, providing relief from coughing. Never give honey to infants under one year due to the risk of botulism.\n- **Ensure Adequate Fluids**: For babies, ensure they are receiving adequate breast milk or formula. For older babies, small amounts of water can help thin mucus and keep the throat moist.\n\n## How to Stop an Asthma Cough at Night?\n\nAccording to the [ACAAI](https://acaai.org/asthma/asthma-101/facts-stats/), **8.3%** of Americans have asthma. Managing an [asthma cough](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/understanding-cough-sound#what-does-an-asthma-cough-sound-like) at night requires a multifaceted approach focused on both immediate relief and long-term control of asthma symptoms.\n\n- **Medication**: Ensure your asthma is well-controlled with a consistent routine of controller medications, such as inhaled corticosteroids, which reduce inflammation in the airways and prevent symptoms. Use these medications as prescribed by your healthcare provider, even when feeling well.\n- **[Allergen](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/allergy-headache-relief#common-allergy-triggers) Reduction**: Identify and minimize exposure to asthma triggers, especially in the bedroom. Common triggers include dust mites, pet dander, and pollen. Use an allergen-proof mattress and pillow covers, wash bedding in hot water weekly, and keep pets out of the bedroom. Maintaining a clean, dust-free environment and using an air purifier can further reduce irritants.\n- **Relaxation Techniques**: Practices such as gentle breathing exercises or using a saline nasal spray to clear the nasal passages before bed can improve respiratory comfort and reduce the likelihood of coughing episodes.\n\n## Wheezing Cough at Night\n\nA wheezing cough at night, often a symptom of conditions like asthma, [GERD](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/effective-gerd-cough-management), or respiratory infections, can severely impact sleep quality. Addressing the wheezing aspect is crucial, as it indicates narrowed or obstructed airways.\n\n- **Asthma Action Plan**: Follow a tailored asthma action plan developed with your healthcare provider. This plan should include the use of controller medications to reduce airway inflammation and prevent wheezing. Assess the sleeping environment for potential triggers, such as allergens or irritants, and take steps to minimize exposure.\n- **Lifestyle Adjustments**: Avoid late meals and foods that trigger acid reflux. Elevate the head while sleeping and use medications to reduce stomach acid as prescribed by a healthcare professional.\n- **Symptom Relief**: Stay hydrated, use a humidifier, and consult a healthcare provider for appropriate medications if necessary. Focus on supporting the body's immune response to clear the infection.\n\n## How to Sleep with a Cough?\n\nAchieving restful sleep with a persistent cough can be challenging, but several strategies can help mitigate coughing and promote a more comfortable night's sleep.\n\n- **Elevate Your Head**: Lying flat can worsen coughing by allowing mucus to accumulate in the throat. Use extra pillows to create a slight incline, encouraging mucus to drain away from the throat and reducing the cough reflex. This position can also help prevent stomach acid from reaching the throat, which is beneficial for those suffering from reflux, a common cause of nighttime coughing.\n- **Use a Humidifier**: Dry air can irritate respiratory passages and exacerbate coughing. Using a humidifier to maintain optimal humidity levels in the bedroom can provide significant relief by soothing irritated airways and making breathing easier.\n- [**Warm Drinks**](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/effective-drinks-and-food-for-cough): Herbal tea with honey can provide immediate relief for a sore throat. Honey has natural antimicrobial and soothing properties, making it an excellent remedy for coughs. Staying hydrated throughout the day also helps thin mucus, making it easier to clear and reducing the urge to cough.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
