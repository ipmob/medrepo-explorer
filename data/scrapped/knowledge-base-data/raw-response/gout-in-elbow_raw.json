Gout is a type of arthritis caused by **excess uric acid in the blood**. This [uric acid](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/uric-acid#what-do-abnormal-levels-mean) can form crystals, which deposit in joints, including the elbow.\n\nWhen these crystals accumulate, they cause inflammation and pain. Gout can affect any joint, but it is less common in the elbow compared to the big toe or [knee](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/gout-in-knee).\n\n## What causes gout in the elbow?\n\n[Gout](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/gout-vs-bunion#what-is-gout) in the elbow is caused by high levels of uric acid in the blood. Uric acid forms when the body breaks down purines, which are substances found in certain foods and drinks. When the kidneys do not eliminate enough uric acid, it builds up and forms crystals in the joints.\n\nFactors contributing to high uric acid levels include:\n\n- **Diet**: Eating foods high in purines, such as red meat, seafood, and certain vegetables.\n- **Alcohol consumption**: Drinking alcohol, especially beer and spirits, increases uric acid levels. People who consume large amounts of alcohol, especially **beer**, are at a higher risk of developing gout. “Gout attacks can be brought on by purine-rich foods or drinks, and beer is high in purines,” [states](https://www.arthritis.org/health-wellness/healthy-living/nutrition/foods-to-limit/alcohol) Dr. Costenbader from Arthritis Foundation.\n- **Genetics**: Having a family history of gout can increase the risk.\n- **Health conditions**: Obesity, [diabetes](https://docus.ai/tags/diabetes), hypertension, and kidney disease can lead to higher uric acid levels.\n- **Medications**: Certain medicines can reduce the body's ability to remove uric acid.\n\n## What are the symptoms of elbow gout?\n\nSymptoms of gout in the elbow can be quite painful and disruptive. Common symptoms include:\n\n- **Severe Pain**: Intense pain in the elbow joint, often starting suddenly, typically [at night](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/how-to-stop-gout-pain-at-night).\n- **Swelling**: Noticeable swelling around the elbow joint, making it appear larger than usual.\n- **Redness**: The skin over the affected area may become red and warm to the touch.\n- **Tenderness**: The elbow may be extremely tender, making it difficult to move or touch.\n- **Limited Movement**: Difficulty moving the elbow joint due to pain and swelling.\n- **Tophi**: In chronic cases, lumps of uric acid crystals, called tophi, can form under the skin.\n\n## Home remedies to treat gout in the elbow\n\nSeveral home remedies can help [manage and alleviate symptoms](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/10-minute-gout-relief) of gout in the elbow:\n\n- **Rest the Joint**: Avoid using the affected elbow to prevent further irritation and allow it to heal.\n- **Cold Compress**: Apply a cold compress or ice pack to the elbow for 15-20 minutes to reduce pain and swelling.\n- **Hydrate**: Drink plenty of water to help flush uric acid from your body.\n- **Dietary Changes**: Avoid foods high in purines, such as red meat, seafood, and alcohol, to lower uric acid levels.\n- **Elevate the Elbow**: Keep the elbow raised to help reduce swelling.\n- **Maintain a Healthy Weight**: Losing weight can reduce uric acid levels and decrease the frequency of gout attacks.\n\nThese remedies can help manage symptoms, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and [gout treatment](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/gout-removal).\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
