However, pain under the [big toe](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/understanding-numb-big-toe) joint can turn this simple act into a daily challenge. This discomfort often results from **repetitive strain**, such as long periods of standing or walking, especially in shoes lacking proper support.\n\nSpecific foot conditions like **bunions** or **sesamoiditis** can also impact the foot's structure and function, leading to pain.\n\nThe big toe plays a crucial role in providing stability and propulsion when walking. Pain in this area can significantly affect mobility. Hard, unforgiving surfaces can increase stress on the big toe joint, exacerbating pain.\n\n**Solutions and Remedies include:**\n\n**1\\. Footwear**: Choose shoes with proper support and cushioning.\n\n**2\\. Surface Consideration**: Avoid hard surfaces when possible.\n\n**3\\. Exercises**: Integrate foot exercises into your daily routine, such as:\n\n- Toe curls\n- Marble pickups\n- Towel scrunches\n\n**4\\. Stretching**: Regularly stretch the Achilles tendon and calf muscles to reduce the force transmitted to the big toe joint.\n\n**5\\. Over-the-Counter Remedies**: NSAIDs can reduce pain and swelling, but use them judiciously.\n\n**6\\. Complementary Therapies**: Massage and acupuncture may provide symptom relief for some individuals.\n\nCombining these methods with medical treatments and physical therapy offers a comprehensive approach to managing and alleviating pain under the big toe joint.\n\n## Pain in the Middle Toe When Walking\n\n[Pain in the middle toe when walking](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/overcome-toe-pain-when-walking#middle-toe-pain-when-walking) can be perplexing and frustrating, affecting basic mobility and comfort. Conditions such as hammertoe, neuromas, or metatarsalgia can contribute to this pain.\n\nThese conditions often involve issues with the **joints**, **ligaments**, and surrounding **tissues** in the toe, causing discomfort during movement.\n\n**Addressing Footwear and Support:**\n\n- **Footwear**: Choose shoes with a wide toe box, adequate cushioning, and proper support to reduce pressure on the toes and joints.\n- **Orthotic Inserts**: Tailored inserts can correct abnormal gait patterns and reduce stress on the affected toe joints.\n\nFor conditions not improving with conservative measures, consider:\n\n- **Corticosteroid Injections**: Reduce inflammation and pain in the toe joints.\n- **Custom Orthotics**: Provide tailored support to alleviate joint stress.\n- **Surgery**: Address underlying structural deformities or nerve pressure impacting the joints.\n\nEach treatment approach should aim to address the underlying cause of pain, ensuring a comprehensive solution tailored to the individual's needs.\n\n## How to Relieve Thumb Joint Pain\n\nThumb joint pain can significantly impede your ability to **grasp**, **pinch**, and perform fine **motor tasks**. Conditions like **De Quervain's tenosynovitis** or **thumb arthritis**, characterized by inflammation and degenerative changes, often cause this pain.\n\nNotably, up to **15%** of the population older than 30 years suffers from symptomatic thumb carpometacarpal (CMC) osteoarthritis (OA), according to the [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6209361/#:~:text=Up%20to%2015%25%20of%20the,hand%20joints%20affected%20by%20OA.) published in the NCBI.\n\nStrategies for Relief\n\n- **Rest and Protection**: Avoid activities that strain the thumb.\n- **Ergonomic Adjustments**: Use ergonomically designed tools and utensils to minimize stress on the thumb joint.\n- **Advanced Treatments**: Options like splinting, occupational therapy, or regenerative medicine techniques such as PRP injections may be explored for persistent pain.\n- **Exercises**: Incorporate thumb stretches and strengthening exercises, such as:\n\n1. Thumb flexor stretches\n2. Thumb extensor stretches\n3. Grip strengthening exercises with soft stress balls or resistance bands\n\nThese treatments aim to reduce inflammation, promote healing, and restore function. The choice of treatment should be personalized based on the individual's condition, lifestyle, and goals.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
