They often have a narrow base, are elongated, and have a high placement on the chest. The areola may appear **larger** and **more prominent**. This condition can affect one or both breasts, leading to asymmetry.\n\n“ _The exact causes of tubular breasts are not entirely clear, but they are believed to be a result of a developmental anomaly during puberty and genetic factors may also play a role_”, states a plastic surgeon Dr. Banwell in his [interview](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/body/a45322757/tubular-breasts/) with Cosmopolitan.\n\n**Hormonal factors** may play a role in the abnormal development of the breast tissue. Tubular breasts do not usually affect breast function or overall health, but they can impact self-esteem and body image.\n\n## What is PCOS?\n\n[Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/pcos-overview) is a hormonal disorder common among women of reproductive age. It is characterized by [irregular menstrual periods](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/8-types-of-abnormal-menstruation#types-of-abnormal-menstruation), excess androgen levels (male hormones), and polycystic ovaries. Symptoms include weight gain, [acne](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/pcos-acne), excessive hair growth, and difficulty getting pregnant. Women with PCOS may also experience thinning hair\n\nAccording to the Penn State World Student Affairs [data](https://studentaffairs.psu.edu/health-wellness/healthcare-and-medical-services/health-information-resources/polycystic-ovary#:~:text=Polycystic%20ovary%20syndrome%20(PCOS)%20is,their%20overall%20health%20and%20appearance.), PCOS affects approximately **1 in 10 women** of childbearing age. Risk factors include a family history of PCOS, obesity, and insulin resistance.\n\n**The exact cause of PCOS is not fully understood**, but it involves a combination of **genetic** and **environmental factors**. Early diagnosis and treatment can help manage symptoms and reduce the risk of complications.\n\n## How are Tubular Breasts and PCOS Connected?\n\n**There is no direct evidence that links tubular breasts with PCOS**.\n\nTubular breasts are a congenital condition related to breast development, while PCOS is a hormonal disorder affecting the ovaries. However, both conditions involve hormonal factors, which may suggest some indirect connection.\n\nHormonal imbalances are a key feature of PCOS, leading to symptoms like irregular periods and excess androgen levels. These hormonal changes can impact overall development and body features.\n\n**While tubular breasts are not caused by PCOS, hormonal imbalances in PCOS might influence breast tissue development in some cases.**\n\n## What Are the Symptoms of Tubular Breasts in Individuals with PCOS?\n\n**Physical Appearance and Changes**:\n\n- Breasts may appear elongated.\n- Narrow base and high placement on the chest.\n- The areola might be larger and more prominent.\n- Characteristics are consistent with tubular breasts, not specifically altered by PCOS.\n\n**Associated Discomfort or Complications**:\n\n- Tubular breasts primarily affect physical appearance.\n- Can lead to discomfort due to ill-fitting bras.\n- Social stress may occur due to the appe arance.\n- Individuals with PCOS might experience additional discomfort from PCOS-related symptoms (for example, weight fluctuations and skin issues).\n- Tubular breasts themselves do not typically cause physical health complications.\n\n## How is the Diagnosis of Tubular Breasts with PCOS Made?\n\n- Diagnosis of tubular breasts involves a physical examination by a healthcare provider.\n- Medical history is reviewed to understand the development of breast tissue.\n- Imaging tests like mammograms or ultrasounds may be used to assess breast structure.\n- PCOS diagnosis requires different evaluations, including a pelvic exam.\n- [Blood tests check hormone levels](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/hormone-blood-test) to identify hormonal imbalances.\n- Ultrasound of the ovaries detects the presence of cyst\n\n## What Treatment Options Are Available for Tubular Breasts with PCOS?\n\n**Surgical and Non-Surgical Interventions**:\n\n- Surgical options for tubular breasts include breast augmentation or reconstruction.\n- Surgery aims to improve breast shape and symmetry.\n- Non-surgical options might include specialized bras for better support.\n- Psychological support and counseling can help with body image issues.\n\n**Hormonal Therapies and Lifestyle Changes**:\n\n- Hormonal therapies for PCOS may help regulate menstrual cycles and reduce symptoms.\n- Lifestyle changes like a balanced diet and regular exercise are crucial.\n- Weight management can improve PCOS symptoms and overall health.\n- Stress reduction techniques, such as yoga or meditation, can be beneficial.\n- Comprehensive care involves addressing both physical and psychological aspec\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
