It's identified by a rectal temperature over **100.4°F (38°C)**. Symptoms like fussiness and lethargy also indicate fever.\n\nA significant percentage of parents are unsure how to measure fever in newborns, as reported in [Pediatrics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6259540/). Prompt consultation with healthcare professionals is critical, especially for babies under three months, to ensure appropriate care.\n\nContents\n\n- [How to Know if Baby Has Fever Without Thermometer?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/newborn-baby-fever-essential-tips#how-to-know-if-baby-has-fever-without-thermometer)\n- [What Should My Baby Wear to Bed with a Fever?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/newborn-baby-fever-essential-tips#what-should-my-baby-wear-to-bed-with-a-fever)\n- [How to Tell if a Newborn Has Fever?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/newborn-baby-fever-essential-tips#how-to-tell-if-a-newborn-has-fever)\n- [What to Feed a Toddler with Fever?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/newborn-baby-fever-essential-tips#what-to-feed-a-toddler-with-fever)\n- [When Do You Go to Hospital for Fever?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/newborn-baby-fever-essential-tips#when-do-you-go-to-hospital-for-fever)\n\n## How to Know if Baby Has Fever Without Thermometer?\n\nTypically, babies with a fever may feel warmer than usual to the touch, particularly on their **forehead**, **back**, or **stomach**. They might also exhibit signs such as increased irritability, poor feeding, unusual sleepiness, or a flushed appearance. However, these signs aren't always conclusive.\n\nIt's crucial to remember that while these methods can suggest the presence of a fever, they are not substitutes for a clinical thermometer, which provides an accurate measurement. If you suspect your baby has a fever, it's best to confirm with a thermometer and consult a healthcare provider, especially if the baby is under three months old.\n\n## What Should My Baby Wear to Bed with a Fever?\n\nThe goal is to ensure the baby is comfortable, neither too hot nor too cold. **Overdressing** a baby with a fever can lead to overheating, while **underdressing** may make them uncomfortably cold. The best approach is to dress them in lightweight, breathable clothing. A single layer, like a cotton onesie, is often sufficient.\n\nAvoid heavy pajamas or swaddling in blankets. If the room temperature is cool, a light blanket can be used, but it's essential to ensure that the baby doesn’t become overheated. Also, keep the room at a comfortable temperature, ideally between **68-72** **degrees** Fahrenheit ( **20-22 degrees** Celsius).\n\nMonitoring your baby’s temperature throughout the night is crucial. If they seem too warm, remove a layer of clothing or adjust the room temperature. Trust your instincts and consult a pediatrician if you're unsure.\n\n## How to Tell if a Newborn Has Fever?\n\nThe most reliable way to tell if a newborn has a fever is by using a digital thermometer to take a rectal temperature. A rectal temperature of **100.4°F** (38°C) or higher is considered a fever.\n\nWhen taking your newborn's temperature, ensure you're doing it correctly. Place the baby on their back, lift their legs, and insert the thermometer gently into the rectum. Wait for the thermometer to signal that it's done, then remove it and check the reading.\n\nBesides using a thermometer, observe your newborn for symptoms like unusual **fussiness**, **lethargy**, **poor feeding**, or a **rash**.\n\nIf you suspect your newborn has a fever, especially if they're less than three months old, contact your healthcare provider immediately.\n\n## What to Feed a Toddler with Fever?\n\nFeeding a toddler with a fever can be challenging, as they often have reduced appetites. The key is to offer foods that are easy to eat and gentle on the stomach. **Hydration** is also crucial, so encourage fluids like water, clear broths, or electrolyte solutions.\n\nSoft, bland foods are ideal. Options include **applesauce**, **yogurt**, or **rice**. If your toddler is willing, you can try more substantial foods like chicken soup, which is nourishing and hydrating. Avoid **spicy** or **fatty foods**, as they can be hard to digest.\n\nRemember, it's normal for a toddler with a fever to eat less than usual. Focus on keeping them hydrated and offer food in small, frequent portions. If you're concerned about their food intake or hydration, consult a **pediatrician**.\n\n## When Do You Go to Hospital for Fever?\n\nKnowing when to take your child to the hospital for a [fever](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/when-to-go-to-the-hospital-for-fever) is crucial. For newborns and infants **under three months**, a fever of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher is a medical [emergency](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/er-for-fever-when-to-seek-emergency-care), and you should seek immediate medical attention.\n\nFor older children, other symptoms accompanying the fever can indicate the need for hospital care. These include **difficulty breathing**, **persistent vomiting**, a **rash** that doesn't fade when pressed, severe **headache**, **neck stiffness**, or a [fever that persists](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/how-long-does-fever-last-timelines-and-treatment) for more than five days.\n\nAlways trust your instincts as a parent. If your child appears severely ill, don't hesitate to seek medical care, regardless of the fever's exact temperature.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
