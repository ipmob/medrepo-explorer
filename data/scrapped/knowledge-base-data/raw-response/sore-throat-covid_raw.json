In some cases, individuals may be asymptomatic or present with other symptoms not typically associated with respiratory infections.\n\nGiven the variability of symptoms and the prevalence of other illnesses that can cause a sore throat, such as the **flu** or a **common** **cold**, it's critical to seek medical advice if you suspect COVID-19 as the cause.\n\nTesting remains a key method for confirming infection, alongside an evaluation of symptom patterns and potential exposure.\n\nIf you develop a sore throat and are concerned about COVID-19, consider your recent activities and contacts, and consult healthcare guidance on testing and self-isolation.\n\n## What Does COVID Sore Throat Feel Like?\n\nA sore throat associated with COVID-19 often feels like a **scratchy** or **irritating** **sensation** in the throat, which can be mild or severe. Some individuals describe the sensation as having a **painful** **dryness** or feeling as though they have to **swallow over a lump**.\n\nThe discomfort can make it **difficult to swallow, eat, or even talk**. Unlike strep throat, which is bacterial and can cause severe throat pain quickly, a COVID sore throat may start gradually and worsen over a few days.\n\nThe experience of a sore throat with COVID-19 can vary widely from person to person.\n\nFor some, it may be their first or most noticeable symptom, prompting them to seek testing.\n\nFor others, it might appear alongside or after other symptoms, such as fever, fatigue, or coughing.\n\nThe diversity in symptom presentation underscores the virus's unpredictable nature and its ability to affect individuals differently.\n\nIt's also worth noting that a COVID sore throat might feel similar to sore throats caused by other illnesses, making it challenging to differentiate without a test.\n\nHowever, attention to the combination of symptoms and the context (e.g., known exposure to the virus) can provide important clues.\n\nIf experiencing a sore throat alongside other COVID-19 symptoms, especially if you've been in close contact with someone who tested positive or are in a high-risk area, it's advisable to get tested and follow public health guidelines regarding isolation and treatment.\n\n## Does COVID Sore Throat Have Any Visible Signs?\n\nCOVID sore throats often present with symptoms similar to those of a regular sore throat but can occasionally exhibit unique characteristics due to the viral infection.\n\nIn general, a COVID-related sore throat might be harder to distinguish just by visible signs alone, as most symptoms are felt rather than seen.\n\nHowever, individuals may notice some **redness** or **swelling** in the throat when looking in a mirror, which is common with many throat infections.\n\nAdditionally, white patches or streaks of pus, a common indicator of strep throat, are less associated with COVID-19.\n\nFor those with COVID-19, a sore throat is usually accompanied by other symptoms such as **fever**, **cough**, **loss of taste or smell**, and **fatigue**.\n\nThese accompanying symptoms often provide better clues that one is dealing with COVID-19 rather than a different type of viral or bacterial infection.\n\nIn the context of the pandemic, it's important to consider these symptoms holistically, especially if they occur in clusters or alongside known exposure to the virus.\n\nGiven the range of symptoms that can occur with COVID-19, it's critical to use more than just visible signs to diagnose the illness.\n\nTesting remains a key tool in identifying the presence of the virus. If you're experiencing a sore throat along with other symptoms consistent with COVID-19, it's advisable to get tested.\n\nRecognizing the broader context of your symptoms and exposures can help in determining whether your sore throat is related to COVID-19 or another cause.\n\n## How Long Does COVID Sore Throat Last?\n\nA COVID-19 sore throat usually lasts between **5 to 7 days**.\n\nFor some individuals, the sore throat might resolve more quickly, within a **few days**, while for others, it can persist longer, **up to two weeks**.\n\nThe duration can vary based on several factors, including the individual's overall health, the severity of the infection, and whether they have any underlying conditions.\n\n## How to Get Rid of COVID Sore Throat?\n\nRelieving a sore throat caused by COVID-19 involves symptomatic treatment and general wellness practices.\n\nSince there's no specific cure for COVID-19 that directly targets a sore throat, the approach is to ease the discomfort while the body fights off the virus.\n\n**Hydration** is key; drinking plenty of fluids can keep the throat moist and relieve the pain.\n\n**Warm** **beverages**, like tea with honey, can offer soothing relief, while cold treats like ice cream or popsicles can numb the throat area, providing temporary pain relief.\n\nOver-the-counter **pain** **relievers**Â can help reduce inflammation and alleviate pain. It's important, however, to use these medications according to the instructions on the label and to consider any personal health conditions that might affect their safety.\n\nAdditionally, **gargling** **with** **salt** **water** is a traditional remedy that can ease sore throat pain for some individuals.\n\nMaintaining a **well-humidified environment** can also help by preventing the air from becoming too dry, which can exacerbate throat discomfort.\n\nUsing a **humidifier**, especially during dry seasons or in dry climates, can make breathing more comfortable.\n\nLastly, **rest** is a critical component of recovery.\n\nGiving your body ample time to heal can speed up the process of overcoming the virus, including alleviating a sore throat.\n\nIf symptoms persist or worsen, it's important to seek medical advice, as they can provide guidance tailored to your specific health situation.\n\n## Why do I only get a sore throat at night with COVID?\n\nExperiencing a sore throat specifically at night during a COVID-19 infection can be particularly uncomfortable and puzzling.\n\nThis phenomenon, while not exclusive to COVID-19, can be exacerbated by various factors related to the body's response to the virus and environmental conditions.\n\nOne reason for nighttime worsening could be the **lying down position**. When you lie down, **mucus** from the nasal passages can accumulate and irritate the throat.\n\nThis is especially true if COVID-19 has led to increased **nasal** **congestion**.\n\nAdditionally, lying down can make it harder for your body to clear this mucus, leading to a sensation of increased throat soreness.\n\nAnother factor could be the **dryness** **of the air** in your sleeping environment.\n\nDuring sleep, you may breathe through your mouth, especially if nasal congestion is present. This can dry out the mucous membranes of the throat, making soreness more pronounced.\n\nUsing a humidifier in your bedroom at night can help alleviate this by adding moisture to the air, which in turn helps keep the throat lubricated and reduces irritation.\n\nThe body's inflammatory responses also play a role. **Inflammation** tends to increase during the night, partly because of changes in the levels of cortisol, the body's natural **anti-inflammatory hormone**, which is lower at night.\n\nThis decrease in **cortisol** can lead to increased inflammation and pain, including in the throat. Managing a nighttime sore throat involves addressing these contributing factors.\n\nStaying **hydrated** throughout the day, using extra pillows to elevate your head while sleeping, and maintaining a comfortable humidity level can all help minimize discomfort.\n\nIf a sore throat persists or is severe, it is advisable to seek medical advice, as they may recommend additional treatments or interventions specific to your situation and overall health.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
