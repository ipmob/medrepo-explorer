Issues such as [acid reflux](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/overview-of-gerd), ulcers, and gastritis are common culprits.\n- **Infections**: [Viral](https://docus.ai/tags/viral-infections) or bacterial infections may cause nausea that persists. Common examples include food poisoning, stomach flu, and hepatitis.\n- **Inner Ear Problems**: Inner ear disorders can affect balance and lead to long-term nausea. Conditions like [vertigo](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/sinus-infection-vertigo-symptoms-causes-and-management) or Meniere’s disease are often responsible.\n- **Stress and Anxiety**: Psychological factors like stress and [anxiety](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/how-to-recognize-anxiety-in-yourself-and-others) can contribute to prolonged nausea. These conditions can trigger a physical response in the body.\n- [**Pregnancy**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/foods-for-nausea-during-pregnancy): Hormonal changes [during pregnancy](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/managing-nausea-in-the-third-trimester) can cause extended periods of nausea. This is often referred to as morning sickness, although it can last all day.\n- **Chronic Conditions**: Chronic diseases such as [diabetes](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/about-diabetes-toenails) or kidney disease may have nausea as a symptom. Managing these conditions is crucial to reducing nausea.\n- **Medications and Treatments**: Certain medications and treatments may cause long-lasting nausea as a side effect. Chemotherapy drugs like cisplatin and pain relievers such as ibuprofen and aspirin are known examples. According to the [American Cancer Society](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/nausea/nausea-hp-pdq#:~:text=Chemotherapy%2Dinduced%20N%26V%20is%20one,Serious%20metabolic%20derangements.), nausea is a common side effect of chemotherapy, affecting 70-80% of patients.\n\n## How to Treat Long Lasting Nausea?\n\n- **Dietary Changes**: Adjusting your diet can help manage nausea symptoms. Eating smaller, more frequent meals and avoiding spicy or fatty foods may help.\n- **Hydration**: Staying hydrated is crucial in alleviating nausea. Sipping clear fluids like water, broth, or herbal tea can be beneficial.\n- **Rest and Relaxation**: Adequate rest and stress management can reduce nausea. Practices like deep breathing, meditation, and gentle exercise can be helpful.\n- [**Natural Remedies**](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/remedies-and-foods-to-help-with-nausea): Ginger, peppermint, and other natural remedies may provide relief. These can be consumed as teas, candies, or supplements.\n- **Medical Consultation**: Seeking advice from a healthcare provider can help identify and treat the underlying cause. A doctor can perform tests and suggest appropriate treatments.\n- **Medication Adjustments**: Discussing medication changes with a doctor may alleviate nausea symptoms. Sometimes switching medications or adjusting doses can make a difference.\n- **Therapies**: Cognitive behavioral therapy and other therapies can help manage nausea related to anxiety and stress. These approaches can address the psychological factors contributing to nausea.\n\n## When to Seek Help for Long Lasting Nausea?\n\n- If nausea lasts more than a few days without improvement, it's important to consult a healthcare provider\n- Seek help if you experience severe nausea that interferes with daily activities or causes weight loss.\n- Symptoms of dehydration, such as dry mouth, dark urine, and dizziness, warrant immediate medical attention.\n- Nausea accompanied by severe [abdominal pain](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/understanding-causes-of-lower-abdomen-pain) or chest pain should be evaluated by a doctor.\n- A high [fever](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/when-to-go-to-the-hospital-for-fever) along with nausea may indicate an infection that requires medical treatment.\n- If you notice blood in your vomit, seek urgent medical care as it can signal a serious condition.\n- Significant, unintentional weight loss along with nausea should be assessed by a healthcare professional.\n- If you suspect your medication is causing prolonged nausea, consult your doctor for possible alternatives.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
