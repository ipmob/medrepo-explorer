This helps in minimizing discomfort while ensuring the back is not overly reliant on the brace, which can weaken muscles over time.\n- Effectiveness: Best used when engaging in activities that might exacerbate pain, such as lifting heavy objects or prolonged standing.\n\n**Important Considerations**:\n\n- Overuse Risks: Prolonged use can lead to muscle dependency and weaken the back muscles.\n- Lifestyle Integration: Use the brace as part of a comprehensive back care strategy, including exercise and proper ergonomics.\n- Supportive Measures: Combine the use of a back brace with physical therapy, proper posture, and core strengthening exercises to maximize healing.\n\n## What Will Urgent Care Do for Lower Back Pain?\n\nUrgent care centers provide immediate medical attention for acute lower back pain, offering a faster alternative to emergency room visits.\n\n**Initial Assessment**:\n\n- A thorough physical examination to assess pain severity and mobility.\n- Possible imaging tests such as X-rays or MRIs to diagnose underlying causes.\n\n**Treatment Options**:\n\n- Medications: Administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or muscle relaxants to alleviate pain.\n- Physical Therapies: Short-term relief techniques may be demonstrated.\n- Referrals: If necessary, referrals to specialists like orthopedists or physical therapists are provided.\n- Follow-up Care: Urgent care will advise on whether a follow-up with a primary care physician or specialist is necessary.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
