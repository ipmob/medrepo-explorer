It is not fully genetic, but family history can increase your risk.\n\n**Genetics** refers to how certain genes can raise the likelihood of developing a condition, while **hereditary** means traits are directly passed down from parents to children.\n\nDiet, lifestyle, and infections also play a major role in the chances of developing appendicitis.\n\nContents\n\n- [Is appendicitis genetic?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/is-appendicitis-genetic#is-appendicitis-genetic)\n- [Is appendicitis hereditary?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/is-appendicitis-genetic#is-appendicitis-hereditary)\n- [What are the other risk factors for appendicitis?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/is-appendicitis-genetic#what-are-the-other-risk-factors-for-appendicitis)\n\n## Is appendicitis genetic?\n\nAppendicitis is not a genetic condition, meaning it doesn’t come directly from a single gene mutation. However, your **genes can affect your chances** of getting it.\n\nRecent [findings](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/2782356) suggest that one gene, [**NEDD4L**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEDD4L), could be linked to a higher risk of appendicitis. This gene controls certain processes in the body. It affects how the appendix handles [sodium](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/sodium) and water.\n\nChanges (variations) in this gene might cause problems in the appendix. These problems, such as **blockages or swelling**, can lead to appendicitis.\n\nThis doesn’t mean everyone with a variation in this gene will get appendicitis. It simply makes them more likely to develop it if other factors, like infections or blockages, occur.\n\nAlthough genetics plays a role, appendicitis usually results from a mix of genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors.\n\n## Is appendicitis hereditary?\n\nAppendicitis is not a **hereditary disease** in the traditional sense. However, a **familial tendency** has been observed, according to a [study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/145749690709600405). If your parent or sibling had appendicitis, your chances of developing it are slightly higher.\n\nThis doesn’t mean it’s passed down directly like some genetic conditions. Instead, it may be due to:\n\n- **Shared genetic factors** that increase risk.\n- **Common environmental influences**, such as diet or exposure to infections.\n\nMost cases of appendicitis happen **randomly**, without any clear genetic inheritance. However, knowing your family history can help you stay alert to the symptoms.\n\n## What are the other risk factors for appendicitis?\n\nSeveral factors aside from genetics can increase the risk of developing appendicitis:\n\n- **Age:** Appendicitis most commonly affects people between the ages of 10 and 30, although it can occur at any age.\n- **Gender:** Males are slightly more likely to develop appendicitis than females.\n- **Obstruction of the Appendix:** Blockages caused by hardened stool (fecaliths), enlarged lymphoid follicles, parasites, or foreign bodies can lead to inflammation.\n- **Infections:** Gastrointestinal infections or systemic viral infections can cause swelling of lymph nodes in the intestinal wall, which may block the appendix.\n- [**Diet**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/what-food-can-cause-appendicitis) **:** A diet low in fiber and high in refined carbohydrates may contribute to constipation and fecalith formation, potentially increasing the risk.\n- **Lifestyle Factors:** Sedentary habits may affect digestive health, although a direct link to appendicitis is not well-established.\n- **Environmental Factors:** Geographic location and seasons may affect appendicitis rates. Some studies find higher cases at certain times of the year, possibly due to infections.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
