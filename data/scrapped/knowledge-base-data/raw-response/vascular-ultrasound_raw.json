It is commonly used to check for **blockages** or **blood clots**.\n\nVascular ultrasound works by sending high-frequency sound waves into the body. These sound waves bounce off blood vessels and return to the ultrasound machine.\n\nThe machine then converts these sound waves into images that show the structure and function of the blood vessels.\n\nVascular ultrasounds are often used to diagnose conditions like **deep vein thrombosis**, **carotid artery disease**, and **[peripheral artery disease](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/tingling-in-lower-legs)**.\n\nFor example, according to the StatPeals [publication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507708/), approximately **1 in 1,000** people in the U.S. develop deep vein thrombosis each year, making vascular ultrasounds crucial for timely diagnosis.\n\nThey also help in monitoring blood flow in patients with vascular conditions and during surgeries.\n\n## Why Do I Need a Vascular Ultrasound?\n\nYou may need a vascular ultrasound if you have symptoms like **swelling**, [**pain**](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/why-do-my-legs-ache), or **numbness** in your legs or arms.\n\nIt is also recommended if you have risk factors for vascular diseases, such as **high blood pressure**, **diabetes**, or **high cholesterol**.\n\nVascular ultrasounds help doctors diagnose conditions such as **blood clots**, **narrowed arteries**, or **aneurysms**. They are also used to monitor the effectiveness of treatments like surgery or medication in improving blood flow.\n\nIn some cases, vascular ultrasounds are used as a **preventive measure**. They help detect potential issues before they become serious, allowing for early intervention and management.\n\nRegular check-ups can help maintain vascular health, especially in high-risk individuals.\n\n## How to Read Vascular Ultrasound Results?\n\nThe images from a vascular ultrasound show your blood vessels and how blood flows through them.\n\n**Blood flow looks dark** in the images, while the **walls of the vessels appear lighter**.\n\nDoctors look for signs like blockages or blood clots in the images. They also check the **speed of blood flow** and the **size of your blood vessels**. These details help in identifying any issues with your blood vessels.\n\nYour doctor will explain your vascular ultrasound results to you. They will help you understand what the images show about your blood vessels. This explanation is important for deciding on the best treatment for you.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
