Activities that involve repeated bending and stress on the knee, such as sports, can lead to this pain.\n\nConditions such as a **Baker's cyst**, **hamstring tendonitis**, or **meniscus tears** might be responsible for the pain behind the knee. These conditions often result from excessive stress or improper movement.\n\n**Recommended actions** and **preventative measures**:\n\n- Apply ice to the affected area to reduce inflammation.\n- Rest your knee to prevent further injury.\n- Perform gentle stretching and strengthening exercises for the hamstrings and quadriceps.\n- Avoid activities that aggravate the pain.\n- Maintain proper form when squatting to prevent further issues.\n\n## Top of Knee Pain When Squatting\n\nPain at the top of the knee when squatting is often due to strain or **overuse of the quadriceps tendon**.\n\n**Improper squatting technique** can also contribute to this pain.\n\nConditions like **quadriceps tendonitis** or **patellar tendinopathy** may be the underlying causes of pain at the top of the knee. These conditions typically develop from repetitive stress or improper alignment.\n\n**Recommended actions** and **preventative measures**:\n\n- Rest the knee and avoid activities that cause pain.\n- Use ice to reduce inflammation and swelling.\n- Perform gentle quadriceps and hip flexor stretches.\n- Strengthen the surrounding muscles to support the knee.\n- Ensure proper squatting technique to prevent further injury.\n\n## Outside Knee Pain When Squatting\n\nOutside knee pain when squatting can often result from **overuse**, i **mproper technique**, or **sudden twisting movements**.\n\nActivities that involve lateral movements, such as **running** or **jumping**, can place extra stress on the outside of the knee.\n\nPotential underlying conditions:\n\n- **Iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS)** is a common cause of outside knee pain, often due to inflammation of the iliotibial band. According to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21967-iliotibial-band-syndrome), Iliotibial band syndrome accounts for about 12% of running injuries.\n- **Lateral meniscus tears** or ligament injuries might also cause pain in the outer part of the knee.\n- Conditions such as **lateral collateral ligament (LCL) sprain** or **tendonitis** can also contribute to this pain.\n\n**Recommended actions** and **preventative Measures**:\n\n- Rest and avoid activities that exacerbate the pain.\n- Apply ice to reduce inflammation and swelling.\n- Perform gentle stretching and strengthening exercises for the iliotibial band, hip abductors, and quadriceps.\n- Use a foam roller to massage the iliotibial band to alleviate tightness.\n- Ensure proper squatting technique, keeping knees aligned with the toes to prevent further injury.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
