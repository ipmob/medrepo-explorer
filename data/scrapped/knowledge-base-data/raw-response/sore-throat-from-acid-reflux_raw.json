Mild cases usually resolve within a **few days** with proper care and lifestyle adjustments.\n\nThe duration of a sore throat from acid reflux depends on several factors. These include the frequency of acid reflux episodes, dietary habits, stress levels, and overall health.\n\nManaging these factors effectively can help shorten the duration of symptoms.\n\n## What Helps a Sore Throat from Acid Reflux?\n\nFinding relief from a sore throat caused by acid reflux involves a combination of lifestyle changes and home remedies. These approaches aim to reduce acid reflux episodes and soothe the throat.\n\n**Eating smaller meals**, **avoiding late-night snacks**, and maintaining an **upright posture after eating** are beneficial practices.\n\nAdditionally, wearing **loose-fitting clothing** can prevent pressure on the stomach.\n\n**Drinking warm fluids**, such as herbal teas or warm water with honey, can provide relief. Avoiding spicy, fatty, and acidic foods is crucial, as these can trigger reflux.\n\nIncorporating more alkaline foods like bananas and melons can also help balance stomach acid levels.\n\n## How to Get Rid of Burning Sensation in the Throat from Acid Reflux?\n\nThe burning sensation in the throat from acid reflux can be uncomfortable and persistent. It results from stomach acid irritating the lining of the esophagus and throat.\n\nTo quickly alleviate the burning sensation, **drinking water** can help wash away the acid.\n\n**Chewing gum** can increase saliva production, which neutralizes stomach acid.\n\n**Elevating the head while sleeping** can also prevent acid from flowing back into the throat.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
