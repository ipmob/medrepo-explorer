This clouding can significantly **reduce vision**, making it appear as though you are looking through a foggy window.\n\nAccording to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vision-health/about-eye-disorders/index.html#:~:text=An%20estimated%2020.5%20million%20(17.2,their%20lens%20removed%20by%20surgery.), **20.5 million Americans** aged 40 years and older, or 17.2%, have cataracts in one or both eyes, and 6.1 million, or 5.1%, have undergone surgery to have their lens removed operatively.\n\n**Glaucoma** is a group of eye conditions that **damage the optic nerve**, essential for good vision. This damage is often caused by abnormally high pressure in your eye.\n\nThe [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vision-health/about-eye-disorders/glaucoma.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/visionhealth/resources/features/glaucoma-awareness.html) reports that about **3 million Americans** suffer from glaucoma, emphasizing its importance as a health concern. Furthermore, glaucoma is recognized as the world's second leading cause of blindness.\n\nAlthough glaucoma can lead to blindness, early detection, and ongoing treatment can prevent severe vision loss and maintain eye health over time.\n\n## What are the Symptoms of Cataracts and Glaucoma?\n\n**Symptoms of Cataracts:**\n\n- [Blurred Vision](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/solving-blurry-vision-in-one-eye-causes-and-solutions): Vision may appear cloudy or dim.\n- Night Vision Difficulties: Increased difficulty seeing in low-light conditions.\n- Color Fading: Colors may look faded or yellowish.\n- Glare Sensitivity: Lights may appear too bright or have a halo effect around them.\n- Double Vision: A single eye may see double images.\n\n**Symptoms of Glaucoma:**\n\n- Peripheral Vision Loss: Gradual loss of side vision, often in both eyes.\n- Tunnel Vision: In advanced stages, the central vision may remain until the condition becomes severe.\n- Eye Pain: In acute cases, severe pain and redness can occur.\n- Blurred Vision and [Nausea](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/cases-of-long-lasting-nausea): Especially in acute angle-closure glaucoma, which is a medical emergency.\n- [Temporary Blindness](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/temporary-blindness) **:** Temporary episodes of blindness or severely blurred vision can occur, particularly in acute stages of glaucoma.\n\n## What's the Difference Between Glaucoma and Cataracts?\n\nA primary distinction between glaucoma and cataracts lies in **how they affect different parts of the eye**.\n\nGlaucoma results from **increased eye pressure** due to fluid accumulation, **damaging the optic nerve** at the eye's back.\n\nOn the other hand, cataracts form when **protein clumps** develop on the lens at the eye's front.\n\nAnother important difference is in the **reversibility of vision loss**.\n\nCataract-related vision loss can be restored through surgery, whereas glaucoma-related vision loss is typically permanent.\n\nTreatments for glaucoma include medicated eye drops, laser surgery, and microsurgical techniques like trabeculectomy, while cataracts are usually addressed with cataract surgery.\n\n## Which is Worse, Cataracts or Glaucoma?\n\n**Glaucoma is generally considered worse than cataracts** because it can cause permanent vision loss and blindness if untreated.\n\nGlaucoma damages the optic nerve, and this damage is irreversible. In contrast, cataracts cause cloudy vision but can usually be corrected with surgery.\n\nWhile both affect vision, glaucoma's potential for permanent blindness makes it more serious.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
