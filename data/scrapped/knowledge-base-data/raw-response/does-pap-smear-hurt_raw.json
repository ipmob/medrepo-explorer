This might cause a sensation of pressure or mild discomfort.\n\nMost women describe the experience as feeling a quick pinch or a slight cramping during the cell collection. The entire process typically lasts only a **few minutes**.\n\nIf you experience significant pain, it’s important to communicate this to your healthcare provider.\n\n**Note**: _Any minor discomfort experienced is temporary and the test plays a crucial role in preventive health care. The [ACOG](https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/cervical-cancer-screening) advises beginning screening at age 21, irrespective of when sexual activity started._\n\n## How to Prepare for a Pap Smear to Minimize Discomfort?\n\nTo help ensure your Pap smear is as comfortable as possible, consider the following tips:\n\n- **Schedule Smartly:** Try to book the test for a time [when you are not menstruating](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/can-you-get-pap-smear-on-period), as this can reduce sensitivity.\n- **Avoid Certain Activities:** Refrain from sexual intercourse, douching, or using vaginal medicines or spermicidal foams for two days before the test.\n- **Relax Your Muscles:** During the procedure, try to relax your muscles and practice deep breathing to help minimize discomfort.\n- **Communicate:** If you have experienced discomfort during past exams, discuss this with your healthcare provider. They might be able to use a smaller speculum or provide other accommodations to make the process easier.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
