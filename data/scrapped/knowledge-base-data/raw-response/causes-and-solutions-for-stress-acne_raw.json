When you experience stress, your body produces more **cortisol**, a stress hormone. Increased cortisol levels can lead to **higher oil production** in your skin, which can clog pores and result in acne.\n\nWhile **stress can’t directly cause acne**, it can make existing acne worse. Stress also causes inflammation, making acne appear redder and more swollen.\n\nFurthermore, stress might weaken your immune system, reducing your skin's ability to heal and fight off bacteria, leading to more frequent and severe breakouts. [Research](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/479409) published in JAMA Dermatology indicates that stress can exacerbate existing acne conditions, making breakouts more severe.\n\nTherefore, managing stress is crucial for maintaining clear skin.\n\n## What Does Stress Acne Look Like?\n\nStress acne typically appears as **red**, **inflamed pimples** on the skin. These breakouts can include **whiteheads**, **blackheads**, or more severe pustules.\n\nStress acne often looks **redder** and **more irritated** than other types of acne due to the inflammation caused by stress. Unlike other forms of acne, stress acne is more likely to **appear suddenly** and can vary in severity.\n\nIt often appears alongside signs of skin sensitivity, like redness and swelling, making it more noticeable and uncomfortable.\n\n## Where Does Stress Acne Appear?\n\nStress acne commonly appears on the face, especially the **forehead**, **cheeks**, and **jawline**. These areas are prone to oil buildup, which can lead to clogged pores and acne.\n\nBesides the face, stress acne can also develop on the [**neck**](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/managing-neck-acne), [**shoulders**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/combatting-shoulder-acne), and **back**. These non-facial areas are also affected by oil and sweat, contributing to acne formation.\n\nThe reason stress acne appears in these areas is due to the body's response to stress, which increases oil production and can exacerbate acne.\n\n## Stress Acne vs Hormonal Acne\n\nStress acne and hormonal acne have different causes and characteristics.\n\n- **Stress acne** is triggered by emotional stress, leading to an increase in cortisol levels. This type of acne appears suddenly and can be more inflamed and red. It often shows up on the forehead, cheeks, and jawline.\n- **Hormonal acne**, on the other hand, is related to hormonal fluctuations. This type typically appears around the lower face, jawline, and chin. Hormonal acne often consists of deeper, cystic pimples that are painful and persistent.\n\nBoth types require different management approaches due to their distinct causes.\n\n## How to Get Rid of Stress Acne?\n\n- **Maintain a Consistent Skincare Routine**: Cleanse your face twice daily with a gentle cleanser to remove dirt and excess oil.\n- **Manage Stress Levels**: Practice relaxation techniques such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises to reduce stress.\n- **Healthy Diet**: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains to support skin health.\n- **Stay Hydrated**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day to keep your skin hydrated and help flush out toxins.\n- **Avoid Touching Your Face**: Keep your hands away from your face to prevent transferring bacteria and oils that can cause breakouts.\n- **Use Non-Comedogenic Products**: Choose skincare and makeup products labeled non-comedogenic to avoid clogging pores.\n- **Get Enough Sleep**: Ensure you get 7-9 hours of sleep per night to help your body manage stress better.\n- **Exercise Regularly**: Engage in regular physical activity to improve blood circulation and reduce stress levels.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
