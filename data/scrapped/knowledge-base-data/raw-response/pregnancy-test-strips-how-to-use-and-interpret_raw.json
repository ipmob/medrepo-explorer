This hormone is produced during pregnancy.\n\nPregnancy strips are popular because they are **easy to use**, **affordable**, and **provide quick results**. They are widely available at pharmacies and online, making them accessible to many people.\n\n## How to Use a Pregnancy Test Strip?\n\nTo use a pregnancy test strip, follow these simple steps:\n\n1. **Collect a Urine Sample**: Use a clean, dry container to collect your urine.\n2. **Dip the Strip**: Immerse the strip into the urine sample for about 5 to 10 seconds. Make sure to dip it up to the marked line.\n3. **Place on a Flat Surface**: Wait for the indicated time, which varies by brand. Some tests may take 1 to 3 minutes, while others take around 5 minutes.\n4. **Check the Results**: Compare the results with the instructions provided with the test strip.\n\nFor best results, the [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-over-counter-otc-human-chorionic-gonadotropin-hcg-510ks-guidance-industry-and-fda) recommends using **freshly voided first-morning urine** specimens because the hCG concentration is highest at this time.\n\n## How to Read a Pregnancy Test Strip?\n\nReading a pregnancy test strip is straightforward if you follow the instructions carefully:\n\n- **Control Line**: This line indicates that the test is working correctly.\n- **Positive Result**: If the test line appears alongside the control line, the result is positive, indicating pregnancy.\n- **Negative Result**: If only the control line appears, the result is negative, indicating no pregnancy.\n- **Invalid Result**: If no lines or only the test line appears, the test is invalid, and you should repeat it with a new strip.\n- **Unclear Results**: For unclear results, consult the test's instructions or contact a healthcare professional.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
