According to [Medical News Today](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/327201), most people experience some level of discomfort for a few days after initially getting braces and following each tightening session.\n\nManaging this discomfort is crucial not only for comfort but also for ensuring a smooth, uninterrupted progression of dental correction.\n\n- **Cold Compresses**: Applying cold compresses or ice packs to the affected area can significantly reduce swelling and numb the pain. The cold helps constrict blood vessels, which can decrease inflammation and lead to temporary pain relief. Simply wrap a cold pack in a cloth and apply it to the outside of your mouth for about 15-20 minutes every hour as needed.\n- **Soft Foods**: When experiencing braces pain, opting for soft foods can make a big difference. Soft foods require less chewing, which minimizes the pressure and strain on your teeth and gums. Foods like yogurt, smoothies, soups, and mashed potatoes are excellent choices that help avoid further irritation.\n- **Oral Hygiene**: Maintaining optimal oral hygiene is essential in managing braces pain. Poor oral hygiene can lead to food particles and plaque build-up around the brackets, exacerbating pain and discomfort. Regular brushing and flossing, along with the use of an antiseptic mouthwash, can keep your teeth and gums clean and free from irritants.\n- **Wax on Braces**: Dental wax can be a lifesaver for those with braces. Applying a small amount of wax on the brackets can prevent them from rubbing against and irritating the inner lips and cheeks. This wax forms a barrier that protects the soft tissues of your mouth, providing relief from the mechanical irritation caused by metal braces.\n\n## How to Stop Braces Pain Immediately?\n\n- **Cold Water and Treats**: Rinsing with cold water or consuming cold treats like ice cream and smoothies can soothe your mouth, reducing inflammation and discomfort quickly.\n- **Ice Pack Application**: Place an ice pack wrapped in a towel on the affected area for 15-20 minutes every hour to numb the pain and decrease swelling.\n- **Oral Anesthetics**: Applying oral anesthetic gels or liquids directly to the sore areas in your mouth can provide fast-acting pain relief. These products typically contain ingredients that numb the area temporarily.\n- **Pressure Points**: Massaging pressure points on the hand or jawline can provide immediate relief due to their nerve connections to the mouth.\n- **Distraction and Relaxation**: Activities like listening to music or practicing deep breathing can help distract from the pain and reduce stress.\n\nFor persistent pain, consult your orthodontist about safe **over-the-counter pain relievers** to ensure you choose an effective pain management strategy.\n\n## How Long Does Braces Pain Last?\n\nThe duration of braces pain is a common concern for anyone undergoing orthodontic treatment. The length of time you'll experience discomfort can vary widely depending on several factors, including the type of braces and the nature of the adjustments.\n\nTypically, braces pain is **most intense during the first few days** after the braces are initially placed or after a significant adjustment.\n\nIt's common for this initial discomfort to last anywhere from **a few days up to a week**. The pain gradually subsides as your mouth adjusts to the new braces.\n\nAfter routine adjustments, which occur throughout the course of wearing braces, the pain is generally less severe compared to the initial fitting. Most people find that this pain lasts for a few days, usually diminishing significantly **within 3 to 5 days**.\n\nFactors Affecting Pain Duration:\n\n- **Type of Braces**: Some braces, like traditional metal braces, might cause more irritation initially compared to newer, less invasive options like clear aligners.\n- **Adjustment Extent**: The degree of teeth movement required during an adjustment can also affect how much and how long you feel pain.\n- **Personal Pain Tolerance**: Individual pain thresholds vary greatly, which can affect how one perceives and reports pain.\n- **Oral Care Practices**: Good oral hygiene can help reduce irritation and discomfort, whereas poor practices may prolong pain due to inflammation or sores.\n\nIf braces pain persists longer than usual, it's important to discuss it with your orthodontist. Meanwhile, consistent use of pain management techniques like those mentioned in earlier sections can alleviate prolonged discomfort.\n\n## How to Manage Braces and Wisdom Tooth Pain Together?\n\nExperiencing both braces pain and wisdom tooth discomfort simultaneously is not uncommon. Understanding how to manage these types of dental pain effectively is crucial for maintaining overall oral health and comfort.\n\nBraces adjustments often shift teeth and can exert **pressure on your jaw**, potentially aggravating any existing [wisdom tooth](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/wisdom-tooth-pain-relief-tips-and-solutions) discomfort. Likewise, the eruption or movement of wisdom teeth can influence the alignment process and increase overall mouth sensitivity.\n\nTo alleviate pain from both conditions at once, consider these methods:\n\n- **Cold Compresses**: Apply a cold compress externally on the cheek near the affected area to help reduce inflammation and numb pain.\n- **Soft Diet**: Eating soft foods minimizes the stress on your teeth and gums. Foods like yogurt, soups, and smoothies are gentle on your mouth and less likely to irritate sensitive areas.\n- **Hydration**: Staying well-hydrated can also ease the pain, as a dry mouth often worsens discomfort.\n- **Oral Hygiene**: Keeping your mouth clean is essential. Brush gently around both your braces and wisdom teeth areas to avoid further irritation while preventing infection.\n- **Medication Considerations**: Over-the-counter pain relievers can be effective, but it's important to consult with your dentist or orthodontist before starting any new medication to ensure it's appropriate for your specific needs.\n\nIf pain persists or if you notice signs of infection (such as swelling, severe pain, or [fever](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/when-to-go-to-the-hospital-for-fever)), it's important to visit your dental professional. They can determine if your braces need adjusting or if your wisdom teeth require further treatment.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
