According to the American Gastroenterological Association ( [AGA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8397289/)), a considerable number of individuals experiencing chronic constipation report experiencing lower back pain.\n\n## Why Does Constipation Cause Back Pain?\n\nConstipation can cause back pain due to several interconnected reasons.\n\nPrimarily, the accumulation of stool in the colon creates **excessive pressure inside the abdomen**. This pressure can push against the spine and lower back muscles, leading to discomfort and pain.\n\nThe body's natural response to pain and discomfort is to tense up, which can result in the muscles around the spine and lower back becoming tight and sore.\n\nAdditionally, the **effort required to pass hardened stool** can lead to straining. This straining not only increases abdominal pressure but also places stress on the lower back muscles and spinal column.\n\nOver time, this can lead to muscle fatigue, tension, and pain. The posture adopted during prolonged sitting on the toilet, especially if not ergonomically supportive, can further exacerbate back pain.\n\nFor those experiencing **chronic** **constipation**, the ongoing cycle of build-up, straining, and relief can lead to persistent lower back discomfort.\n\nAddressing the underlying constipation is often key to relieving associated back pain.\n\nThis may involve dietary changes, increased physical activity, hydration, and, in some cases, medical intervention to ensure proper bowel function and alleviate the pressure and strain on the lower back.\n\n## Where is Constipation Pain Felt in the Back?\n\nConstipation pain felt in the back is typically localized to the **lower** **lumbar** **region**, though the exact location and intensity of the pain can vary from person to person based on the severity of constipation and individual differences in pain perception and body structure.\n\nThe lower back pain associated with constipation is often a **dull**, aching sensation that can become more pronounced during periods of prolonged sitting or standing, which may increase the pressure exerted on the lower back area.\n\nThe mechanism behind this pain involves the pressure buildup in the abdomen as a result of **constipation**.\n\nThe colon, when filled with stool due to constipation, can exert pressure on the lower back through its proximity to the lumbar spine and the muscles that support the back.\n\nThis pressure can lead to discomfort and pain, as the back muscles may become strained or overworked in attempting to support the additional burden.\n\nAdditionally, the effort to maintain posture despite the discomfort in the abdomen can further strain these muscles, leading to soreness and stiffness in the lower back area.\n\nFurthermore, constipation can lead to **bloating** and **gas**, which can also contribute to back pain by increasing intra-abdominal pressure.\n\nThis increased pressure can push against the **spine** and **back** **muscles**, causing discomfort. In some cases, severe constipation can lead to [**nerve compression**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/nerve-compression-syndrome) or irritation in the lower back, resulting in pain that may radiate from the lower back down to the buttocks and legs, further complicating the experience of constipation with additional musculoskeletal symptoms.\n\n## How to Relieve Lower Back Pain from Constipation?\n\nRelieving lower back pain caused by constipation involves addressing both the constipation and the back pain.\n\nStart with dietary adjustments by increasing your intake of **fiber-rich foods** like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes to soften stool and improve bowel movement regularity, which reduces straining.\n\n**Hydration** is also crucial; aim for **8-10 glasses of water** daily to keep stools soft.\n\nRegular physical activity, such as **walking**, **swimming**, or **yoga**, can strengthen abdominal and back muscles, improving digestive health and reducing back strain.\n\nYoga, in particular, includes poses that gently stretch and strengthen these muscles while promoting relaxation.\n\nFor immediate back pain relief, **gentle stretching exercises** like pelvic tilts, knee-to-chest stretches, or gentle twisting poses can help release muscle tension. Applying **heat with a warm bath** or heating pad can also soothe muscle tension.\n\n[Massage therapy](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/massage-for-constipation-relief) is another effective way to relieve lower back pain and alleviate constipation-related discomfort. Gentle abdominal massages can stimulate the digestive system and promote bowel movements.\n\nLower back massages help alleviate muscle tension and improve circulation. For more targeted relief, consider professional massage therapy with techniques like deep tissue or Swedish massage.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
