According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/common-cold/treatment/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/antibiotic-use/colds.html), millions use OTC cough and cold medicines each year for symptom relief.\n\nUnderstanding the proper dosage and potential risks of misuse is crucial for safe and effective use.\n\nContents\n\n- [How to Make Cough Syrup?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/exploring-cough-syrup#how-to-make-cough-syrup)\n- [How Much is 10 ml of Cough Syrup?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/exploring-cough-syrup#how-much-is-10-ml-of-cough-syrup)\n- [How Long Does Cough Syrup Take to Work?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/exploring-cough-syrup#how-long-does-cough-syrup-take-to-work)\n- [How Much Cough Syrup Can Make You Drunk?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/exploring-cough-syrup#how-much-cough-syrup-can-make-you-drunk)\n\n## How to Make Cough Syrup?\n\nMaking your own [cough](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/what-your-cough-sound-says-about-your-health) syrup at home is simple and cost-effective. It involves using natural ingredients.\n\nYou will need **honey**, **lemon juice,** and **ginger**. These ingredients have natural soothing and anti-inflammatory properties.\n\n**Step-by-step instructions** for making cough syrup:\n\n1. Grate a tablespoon of fresh ginger.\n2. Mix the grated ginger with a cup of honey in a small saucepan.\n3. Add two tablespoons of lemon juice.\n4. Heat the mixture on low for about 10 minutes.\n5. Let it cool, then strain to remove the ginger pieces.\n6. Store the syrup in a clean, airtight bottle.\n\nKeep the syrup in the refrigerator. It should last for up to a month. Take one tablespoon as needed for relief.\n\n## How Much is 10 ml of Cough Syrup?\n\n10 ml of cough syrup is a common dosage. It is equivalent to **two teaspoons**.\n\n## How Long Does Cough Syrup Take to Work?\n\nTypically, cough syrup begins to work within **15 to 30 minutes after ingestion**. The relief can last **several hours**.\n\nEffectiveness can vary based on age, weight, and severity of symptoms. Following dosage instructions is crucial for optimal results.\n\nYou should notice a reduction in coughing frequency and intensity. Your throat may feel less irritated as well.\n\nIf symptoms persist for more than a week or worsen, consult a healthcare provider. The persistent cough might indicate a more serious condition.\n\n## How Much Cough Syrup Can Make You Drunk?\n\nSome misuse cough syrup to feel \"drunk\" due to certain ingredients affecting the central nervous system.\n\nCough syrup may contain **dextromethorphan (DXM)** and **alcohol**, which can cause intoxication in large amounts.\n\nA standard 10 ml dose of cough syrup typically contains **20 to 30 mg** of DXM. Consuming more than the recommended dose can lead to **intoxication**.\n\nThe amount required for intoxication varies based on individual tolerance and the specific formulation of the cough syrup.\n\nOverconsumption can cause serious health risks, such as [**nausea**](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/remedies-and-foods-to-help-with-nausea), [**dizziness**](https://docus.ai/tags/dizziness), and even life-threatening conditions like **respiratory depression**.\n\nAlways follow the dosage instructions on the label and use only to relieve cough symptoms. Consult a healthcare provider if unsure.\n\nFor children, consult a pediatrician to determine the correct dosage.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
