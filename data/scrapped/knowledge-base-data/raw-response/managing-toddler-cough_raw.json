If the cough persists or is severe, consult your pediatrician.\n\n## How to Help a Toddler with Mucus Cough?\n\nTreating a toddler with a mucus cough involves strategies to thin and clear the mucus and soothe the throat.\n\n**Effective Methods**:\n\n- **Hydration**: Encourage plenty of fluids to loosen mucus.\n- **Warm Liquids**: Broth or herbal teas for older toddlers can provide relief.\n- **Saline Drops**: Use saline nasal drops or spray for [nasal congestion](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/newborn-sounds-congested-no-mucus).\n- **Gentle Suction**: Use a bulb syringe for younger toddlers to remove [nasal mucus](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/thick-rubbery-mucus-from-nose).\n- **Cool-Mist Humidifier**: Adds moisture to the air to soothe airways.\n\nTeach older toddlers to blow their nose gently. Avoid over-the-counter cough medications unless directed by a pediatrician.\n\n## What to Do if Baby Cough When Lying Down?\n\nBabies often experience increased coughing when lying down due to mucus accumulation.\n\n**Alleviating Baby's Cough**:\n\n- **Elevate the Head**: Slightly elevate the head of the crib or bassinet.\n- **Hydration**: Ensure the baby is well-hydrated.\n- **Saline Drops and Suction**: Use saline drops followed by gentle suction.\n- **Humidifier**: Keep the air moist with a humidifier.\n\nUse these methods sparingly to avoid irritating the nasal passages.\n\n## When to Worry About Toddler Cough?\n\nA toddler's cough can be worrisome if it's persistent, severe, or accompanied by other concerning symptoms.\n\n**Signs of Serious Illness**:\n\n- **Chronic Cough**: Lasting longer than 3-4 weeks.\n- **Intensifying Cough**: Getting worse over time.\n- [**High Fever**](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/when-to-go-to-the-hospital-for-fever): Persistent high fever.\n- **Breathing Issues**: Difficulty breathing or blue hue around lips/face.\n- **Nighttime Cough**: Severe disruption of sleep, rapid breathing, or wheezing.\n- [**Barking Cough**](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/understanding-cough-sound): Seal-like bark and high-pitched breathing [sound](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/what-your-cough-sound-says-about-your-health) (stridor).\n\nWatch for symptoms like **vomiting** after coughing, **refusal to eat or drink**, or **lack of wet diapers**. These warrant a consultation with a healthcare provider.\n\n## When to Take a Toddler to the Doctor for a Cough?\n\nKnowing when to take your toddler to the doctor for a cough is crucial for ensuring they receive the right care at the right time.
