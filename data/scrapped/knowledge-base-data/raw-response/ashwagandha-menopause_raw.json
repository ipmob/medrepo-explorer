By **improving energy levels** and **enhancing resilience to stress**, ashwagandha supports overall health.\n\nFor [menopause](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/about-menopause), it is particularly beneficial as it balances hormones and reduces stress, alleviating symptoms like anxiety, mood swings, and sleep disturbances.\n\nA [review](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0257843) of five high-quality studies published in PLOS ONE found that ashwagandha significantly enhances sleep quality, reduces anxiety, and helps people feel more refreshed upon waking.\n\n## What are the Benefits of Ashwagandha for Menopause?\n\nAshwagandha offers several specific benefits for menopausal symptoms, making it a valuable natural remedy:\n\n- **Reduces anxiety and depression**: [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6750292/) indicate that ashwagandha can reduce cortisol levels, which can help alleviate anxiety and depression. This makes mood swings less severe and more manageable, improving emotional stability.\n- **Improves sleep quality**: Many women experience sleep disturbances during menopause. Ashwagandha helps improve sleep quality by promoting relaxation and reducing stress, leading to better overall health and well-being.\n- **Supports hormonal balance**: Hormonal imbalances during menopause can cause [hot flashes](https://docus.ai/tags/hot-flashes) and [night sweats](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/night-sweats). Ashwagandha supports hormonal balance, helping to reduce the frequency and severity of these symptoms.\n- **Anti-inflammatory properties**: [Joint pain](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/menopause-joint-pain) and discomfort are common during menopause due to decreased estrogen levels. Ashwagandha's anti-inflammatory properties may help relieve these pains, improving mobility and comfort.\n- **Improves libido**: Menopause can lead to a decrease in libido due to hormonal changes. [Ashwagandha can enhance sexual function and libido](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/does-ashwagandha-make-you-horny), contributing to a healthier and more satisfying sex life.\n\nBy addressing these specific symptoms, ashwagandha can significantly improve the quality of life during menopause, offering a natural way to manage and reduce discomfort.\n\n## Can Ashwagandha Aid in Weight Loss During Menopause?\n\nStress and hormonal imbalances frequently cause weight gain. Ashwagandha reduces stress by lowering cortisol levels, helping to prevent stress-induced weight gain.\n\nAccording to the [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5871210/) from the Journal of Evidence-based Integrative Medicine, treatment with ashwagandha root extract significantly **improved body weight** and **body mass index** in adults experiencing chronic stress.\n\nAdditionally, better sleep quality and reduced anxiety encourage healthier lifestyle choices, further supporting weight loss.\n\n## How Should Ashwagandha Be Taken for Menopause Symptoms?\n\nAshwagandha is available in several forms, including capsules, powders, and liquid extracts. It's essential to follow the dosage instructions provided on the supplement packaging or given by a healthcare professional.\n\nTo incorporate ashwagandha into your daily routine, consider **taking it with meals** to enhance absorption and reduce the risk of stomach upset.\n\nAdding it to a morning and evening routine can help maintain steady levels in your system, providing ongoing support for menopausal symptoms.\n\n## Side Effects of Using Ashwagandha for Menopause\n\nAshwagandha is generally considered safe for most people when taken in recommended doses.\n\nHowever, some potential side effects may include:\n\n- **Stomach upset**: Some individuals may experience mild gastrointestinal issues.\n- **Diarrhea**: This is another potential side effect that tends to decrease over time.\n- [**Nausea**](https://docus.ai/tags/nausea): Some users might feel nauseous initially.\n\nCertain individuals should avoid using ashwagandha:\n\n- **Pregnant and breastfeeding women**: Consultation with a healthcare provider is necessary before use.\n- **People with** [**autoimmune diseases**](https://docus.ai/tags/autoimmune-diseases): Ashwagandha may stimulate the immune system.\n- **Individuals with** [**thyroid disorders**](https://docus.ai/tags/thyroid-issues): Those on thyroid medications should seek medical advice.\n- [**Allergy to nightshade plants**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/nightshade-allergy): Avoid if allergic to plants in the nightshade family.\n\n**Note**: _Always talk to your healthcare provider before starting any new supplement, especially if you have existing health conditions or are taking other medications._\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
