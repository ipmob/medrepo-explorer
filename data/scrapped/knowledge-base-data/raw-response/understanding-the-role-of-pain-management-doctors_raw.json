Your doctor may refer you to a pain management doctor to receive specialized care.\n\nThere are several reasons your doctor might send you to pain management:\n\n- **Chronic Pain**: Pain lasting more than three months that hasn't responded to standard treatments. According to the [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553030/) publication, over one-quarter of United States citizens suffer from chronic pain.\n- **Ineffectiveness of Previous Treatments**: If previous treatments have not managed your pain effectively.\n- **Specialized Care Needs**: Pain management doctors provide care that general practitioners might not offer.\n\nPain management doctors treat a variety of conditions, including:\n\n- [**Back Pain**](https://docus.ai/tags/back-pain): Persistent pain in the lower or upper back.\n- **Arthritis**: Joint pain and inflammation causing significant discomfort.\n- **Neuropathic Pain**: Nerve pain resulting from conditions like diabetes.\n- **Fibromyalgia**: Widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue.\n- **[Cancer](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/most-common-cancers-in-women) Pain**: Pain related to cancer or its treatment.\n\n## What Does a Pain Management Doctor Do?\n\nA pain management doctor is a medical professional who specializes in diagnosing and treating chronic pain. They play a crucial role in helping patients manage pain effectively.\n\nPain management doctors start by reviewing your medical history to understand your pain condition. They perform physical examinations to assess the source and intensity of your pain.\n\nDiagnostic tests and imaging, such as **X-rays** or **MRIs**, may be used to identify the underlying causes of pain.\n\nPain management doctors use a variety of non-surgical interventions to treat pain, including:\n\n- **Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation**: Exercises designed to improve mobility and reduce pain.\n- **Injection Therapies**: Techniques like nerve blocks or steroid injections to manage pain.\n- **Manual Therapy**: Hands-on techniques to manipulate muscles and joints for pain relief.\n- **Electrical Stimulation**: Using electrical impulses to reduce pain signals.\n- **Lifestyle and Pain Management Education**: Guidance on lifestyle changes and techniques to manage pain daily.\n\n## What happens at your first pain management appointment?\n\nThe first pain management appointment is crucial for understanding your pain and creating a treatment plan. This initial visit sets the foundation for your care.\n\n1. **Medical History Review**: Your doctor will start by reviewing your detailed medical history. They will ask about the nature and duration of your pain. You will discuss previous treatments and their effectiveness. This helps the doctor understand your pain condition better.\n2. **Physical Examination**: The doctor will perform a physical examination to assess your pain levels and physical condition. They may ask you to perform certain movements or exercises. This helps them pinpoint the source and severity of your pain.\n3. **Diagnostic Tests**: Depending on your condition, the doctor may order diagnostic tests. These could include imaging tests like X-rays or MRIs. These tests help identify the underlying causes of your pain.\n4. **Treatment Plan Discussion**: At the end of your appointment, the doctor will discuss potential treatment options with you. They will develop a personalized treatment plan tailored to your specific needs. This plan might include a combination of therapies to manage your pain effectively.\n\n## What not to say to your pain management doctor?\n\nClear communication with your pain management doctor is essential for effective treatment. Avoid certain statements to ensure a productive relationship.\n\n- **Don't Exaggerate or Downplay Pain**: Misleading your doctor can lead to improper treatment. Be honest about your pain levels for appropriate care.\n- **Don't Request Specific Medications by Name**: Trust your doctor's expertise to prescribe the best treatment. Asking for specific drugs can raise concerns about misuse.\n- **Don't Mention Illegal Drug Use or Sharing Medications**: Such discussions can have serious legal and medical implications. Focus on providing accurate information about your medical history.\n- **Don't Express Desires for Unrealistic Outcomes**: Understand that pain management aims to improve quality of life, not necessarily eliminate all pain. Setting realistic goals helps in creating an effective treatment plan.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
