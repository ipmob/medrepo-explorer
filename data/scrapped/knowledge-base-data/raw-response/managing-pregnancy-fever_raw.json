Small variations can occur based on the time of day and specific activities undertaken.\n\n**During pregnancy**, a body temperature **of 100.4°F**(38°C) **or higher** is generally considered a fever. It's important to monitor this closely, as maintaining a normal temperature is crucial for the health of both the mother and the developing fetus.\n\nAccording to [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/could-fever-harm-my-baby#How-will-a-fever-affect-my-baby), persistent or high fevers during pregnancy require medical attention due to potential risks to both mother and baby.\n\n## Causes of Fever When Pregnant\n\nFever in pregnant women can be triggered by various infections such as:\n\n- **[Urinary tract infections](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/bladder-infection-vs-uti) (UTIs)**\n\n- **Colds and flu**\n\n- **Respiratory tract infections**\n\nThese are common during pregnancy due to **changes in the immune system** that make women more susceptible to infections.\n\nBesides infections, fever can also result from non-infectious causes such as **dehydration**, **overheating from external temperatures**, or **excessive exercise**.\n\nIt's vital to identify the cause of the fever to address it appropriately and prevent any potential harm to the pregnancy.\n\n## How to Get Rid of a Fever Naturally?\n\n**Safe Natural Remedies for Managing Fever in Pregnancy:**\n\n- Hydration: Drink plenty of fluids like water, herbal teas, and broths to help reduce body temperature and prevent dehydration.\n- Rest: Ensure ample rest as it helps the body fight off infection and recover more quickly.\n- Cool Compresses: Apply a cool cloth to the forehead, back of the neck, or wrists to help reduce body temperature.\n- Light Clothing: Wear light and breathable clothing to allow body heat to escape and cool down naturally.\n- Room Temperature: Keep the room at a comfortable temperature; avoid overheating the environment.\n\n**Tips on When to Seek Medical Attention for a Fever During Pregnancy:**\n\n- Temperature Monitoring: If your temperature reaches 100.4°F (38°C) or higher and does not reduce with natural methods, seek medical advice.\n- Persistent Fever: If the fever lasts more than 24 hours or is accompanied by other symptoms such as a rash, severe headache, or persistent vomiting, consult your healthcare provider.\n- Unusual Symptoms: Immediate medical attention is required if experiencing symptoms like severe abdominal pain, trouble breathing, or confusion.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
