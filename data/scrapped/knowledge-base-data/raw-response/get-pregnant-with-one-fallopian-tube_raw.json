Fertility largely depends on whether the remaining tube is healthy. If the remaining fallopian tube is open and functional, it can still capture an egg during ovulation. The egg can then be fertilized by sperm, leading to pregnancy.\n\nIt's also important that the **ovary on the side of the functioning tube is active**. Regular [menstrual cycles](https://docus.ai/tags/menstruation) often indicate that [ovulation](https://docus.ai/tags/ovulation) is occurring, which is essential for conception. Many women with one fallopian tube successfully conceive naturally.\n\nDr. Sumana Gurunath, Consultant in Infertility and Reproductive Medicine at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Cloudnine Group of Hospitals, Bengaluru, [explained](https://www.onlymyhealth.com/how-can-you-get-pregnant-with-one-fallopian-tube-1717417900): “ _Chances of getting pregnant in one month is usually 25-30% in women less than 30 years. Hence, it often takes a few months for any couple to conceive naturally. Since all women have two ovaries, and a single egg ovulates every month, the side on which ovulation occurs is random. Women with a single open fallopian tube have a chance to conceive only in the month when ovulation occurs on the same side as the open tube._”\n\n## Tips for conceiving with one fallopian tube\n\nConceiving with one fallopian tube may require a bit more attention to your reproductive health and timing. Here are some useful tips:\n\n- **Healthy Lifestyle:** Maintain a balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals to support your reproductive system. Regular exercise helps keep your body in optimal condition, which is crucial for conception.\n- **Monitor Ovulation:** Timing is key when you have one fallopian tube. While [ovulation predictor kits](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/ovulation-test-strips) are useful, the best way to monitor ovulation is through regular ultrasounds performed by a healthcare provider. Ultrasounds can precisely track the development of follicles in the ovaries and confirm the exact time of ovulation.\n- **Consult a Healthcare Provider:** A fertility specialist can evaluate the health of your remaining fallopian tube and ovary. An HSG (hysterosalpingogram) test can check if the fallopian tube is open and functional.\n- **Regular Check-ups:** Regular gynecological check-ups ensure that any underlying conditions, such as [endometriosis](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/endometriosis-explained) or pelvic inflammatory disease, are identified and treated promptly, which could improve your chances of conception.\n- **Stress Management:** High [stress](https://docus.ai/tags/stress) can affect ovulation and overall fertility. Practice stress-reducing techniques such as yoga, meditation, or other relaxation methods to support your reproductive health.\n- **Partner’s Health:** Ensure that your partner’s sperm health is optimal. A [semen analysis](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/semen-analysis-purpose) can help identify any issues that might be affecting your chances of conceiving.\n\nIf natural conception proves challenging, discuss fertility treatment options with your doctor. In some cases, treatments like **IVF (in vitro fertilization)** might be recommended, especially if there are concerns about the health of the remaining tube.\n\n[**Important stats**](https://sartcorsonline.com/CSR/PublicSnapshotReport?ClinicPKID=0&reportingYear=2021) **from the National Summary Report**: _IVF success rates decline sharply with age, as live birth rates per egg retrieval drop from 44.5% in women under 35 to just 2.9% in women over 42, regardless of the number of fallopian tubes._\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
