This is a normal part of the adjustment process as your teeth begin to shift.\n\n**Immediate Remedies**:\n\n- Cold Compresses: Applying a cold compress to the outside of your mouth can significantly reduce swelling and numb the area, providing immediate relief from braces pain. Hold the compress against your cheeks for about 20 minutes every hour as needed.\n- Oral Pain Relievers: Over-the-counter pain relievers can be effective in managing the discomfort caused by braces adjustments. Always follow the recommended dosage instructions and consult with a healthcare provider if unsure.\n- Soft Foods: After an adjustment, stick to soft foods that require little chewing, such as yogurt, soups, and smoothies. Hard or crunchy foods can increase pain and damage braces.\n- Oral Hygiene Tips: Maintain good oral hygiene by gently brushing and flossing. Sometimes, pain from braces can be exacerbated by food particles caught under the wires which irritate the gums and teeth.\n\nIf your pain persists for **more than a few days** or **becomes severe**, it’s important to consult your orthodontist. They might need to adjust the braces or provide additional solutions to help manage your discomfort.\n\n## How to Stop Sensitive Teeth Pain Immediately at Home?\n\n- **Desensitizing Toothpaste**: Use toothpaste formulated for sensitive teeth. These toothpastes contain compounds that help block the transmission of pain signals from the surface of your tooth to the nerve and are typically effective after several applications.\n- **Salt Water Rinse**: Rinsing your mouth with a saltwater solution can help reduce pain and soothe sensitive teeth. Dissolve a teaspoon of salt in a cup of warm water and swish it around in your mouth for 30 seconds before spitting it out.\n- **Avoid Acidic Foods**: Acidic foods and beverages, like citrus fruits, tomatoes, and soda, can aggravate tooth sensitivity. Limiting exposure to these can help minimize discomfort.\n- **Proper Brushing Techniques**: Brush gently with a soft-bristled toothbrush and avoid using too much force. Also, brushing your teeth with lukewarm water can lessen sensitivity during and after brushing.\n- **Medications**: Over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications can be used to reduce inflammation and pain associated with tooth sensitivity. Always follow the recommended dosages and consult with your healthcare provider for guidance specific to your health conditions.\n\n**Persistent tooth sensitivity** or **sudden severe pain** signifies it's time to consult a dentist. They can assess whether your sensitivity is due to a more serious underlying condition that may require specific treatment.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
