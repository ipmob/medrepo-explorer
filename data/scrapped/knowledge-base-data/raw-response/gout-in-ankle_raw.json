This buildup results in sudden, severe pain, redness, and tenderness, particularly during attacks. Gout can appear in different parts of the body, such as the big toe, [heels](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/gout-in-heel), [knees](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/gout-in-knee), [hands](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/gout-in-hand), [shoulders](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/gout-in-shoulder), and [elbows](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/gout-in-elbow).\n\nWhen gout affects the ankle, it causes intense pain, swelling, and inflammation, making movement difficult. The ankle joint may become red and warm to the touch, and the discomfort often [worsens at night](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/how-to-stop-gout-pain-at-night).\n\n## Can you get gout in the ankle?\n\n**Yes, you can get gout in the ankle**. Gout commonly starts in the **big toe** but can affect any joint, including the ankle, where **uric acid crystals accumulate**.\n\nGout in the ankle is fairly common among individuals with gout. The ankle is a frequent site for uric acid crystal deposits, although it is less commonly affected than the big toe.\n\n**Several factors increase the risk of developing gout in the ankle, including**:\n\n- [High levels of uric acid in the blood](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/uric-acid#what-do-abnormal-levels-mean)\n- Diets high in purines, such as red meat and seafood\n- Obesity and certain health conditions like hypertension\n- Genetics and lifestyle choices, such as alcohol consumption\n\n## What are the signs of gout in the ankle?\n\n**Common symptoms**:\n\n- Severe pain\n- Swelling\n- Redness\n- Warmth around the ankle joint\n\nThe pain from gout in the ankle is intense and can last for **several hours to a few days**. Swelling and discomfort might persist for a week or more, with episodes recurring over time.\n\nGout in the ankle can severely impact daily activities. Walking, standing, or any movement can become extremely painful, making routine tasks difficult.\n\n## What does gout look like in the ankle?\n\nAn ankle affected by gout appears **swollen**, **red**, and **tender**. The joint area may look inflamed and feel warm to the touch.\n\nGout can resemble other conditions like a **sprained ankle** or **cellulitis**. However, gout typically presents with more sudden and intense pain compared to these conditions.\n\n**Visual indicators to watch for**:\n\n- Redness and significant swelling\n- Shiny skin over the ankle joint\n- Severe pain accompanying these visual signs\n\n## How to get rid of gout in the ankle?\n\nEffective [gout cure](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/10-minute-gout-relief) requires a combination of lifestyle changes, dietary adjustments, and medical treatments.\n\n**Lifestyle changes and home remedies**:\n\n- Elevate the affected leg to reduce swelling.\n- Apply ice packs to the swollen area to alleviate pain and inflammation.\n- Rest the ankle as much as possible to avoid aggravating the symptoms.\n- Stay well-hydrated and avoid alcohol.\n\n**Dietary recommendations from [Harvard Health](https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/lifestyle-changes-to-reduce-the-risk-of-gout-attacks)**:\n\n- Maintain a low-purine diet to help reduce uric acid levels.\n- Avoid foods like red meat, seafood, and sugary beverages.\n- Increase your intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.\n- Drink plenty of water to help flush out uric acid.\n\n**Medical [treatments](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/gout-removal)**:\n\n- **Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)**: These medications can help reduce pain and inflammation during gout attacks.\n- **Colchicine**: This [FDA-approved](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/colchicine-marketed-colcrys-information) medication is often prescribed to reduce gout pain and inflammation, especially if taken soon after symptoms begin. ( **Caution**: _Colchicine should only be used under the prescription of a doctor_).\n- **Corticosteroids**: These can be taken orally or injected into the affected joint to reduce inflammation and pain.\n- **Urate-lowering therapies**: Medications such as allopurinol and febuxostat can help reduce uric acid levels in the blood, preventing future gout attacks.\n\nSeek medical advice if the pain and swelling do not improve with home remedies. If you experience frequent gout attacks or if the symptoms worsen, it is important to consult a healthcare professional. They can provide a proper diagnosis and recommend appropriate treatment options.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
