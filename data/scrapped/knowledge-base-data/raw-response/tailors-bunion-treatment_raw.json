Non-surgical treatments are important for managing symptoms effectively:\n\n1\\. **Footwear Adjustments**\n\n- Wear Proper Shoes: Choose shoes with a wide toe box to reduce pressure on the bunion.\n- Avoid High Heels: High heels can exacerbate the problem by putting more pressure on the bunion.\n- Custom Orthotics: Use custom orthotic inserts to help redistribute pressure away from the bunion.\n\n2\\. **Padding and Taping**\n\n- Bunion Pads: Apply bunion pads to cushion the area and reduce friction.\n- Toe Spacers: Use toe spacers to help keep toes aligned and relieve pressure.\n- Taping: Tape your foot in a way that aligns the toe and reduces pressure on the bunion.\n\n3\\. **Lifestyle and Home Remedies**\n\n- Ice Therapy: Apply ice packs to the bunion for 15-20 minutes several times a day to reduce swelling.\n- Anti-inflammatory Medications: Take over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications to reduce pain and inflammation.\n- Foot Exercises: Perform foot exercises that strengthen the muscles around the bunion and improve flexibility.\n\n4\\. **Professional Treatments**\n\n- Physical Therapy: Consult a physical therapist for exercises and treatments to alleviate symptoms.\n- Corticosteroid Injections: In some cases, a doctor may recommend corticosteroid injections to reduce severe inflammation.\n- Custom Orthotic Devices: See a podiatrist for custom-made orthotic devices that provide better support and alignment.\n\nIf non-surgical treatments are ineffective, consider discussing surgical options with a specialist.\n\n## Tailor's Bunion Surgery\n\nTailor's bunion surgery, also known as **bunionette surgery**, aims to correct a bony bump on the outside of the foot near the little toe. The procedure involves removing or reshaping the bone and soft tissue to reduce pain and improve foot function.\n\n**Types of surgery**:\n\n- Exostectomy: This involves removing the bony bump without correcting the underlying bone structure.\n- Osteotomy: This involves cutting and realigning the bone to correct the bunionette.\n- Arthroplasty: This involves reshaping the bone and removing part of the joint.\n- Arthrodesis: This involves fusing the joint to correct severe deformities.\n\nThe surgery typically lasts between **30 minutes to 1 hour**, depending on the type of procedure and severity of the bunionette.\n\nRecovery can vary but generally takes about **6-8 weeks**. Patients usually need to wear a special surgical shoe or boot for a few weeks. Physical therapy may be recommended to regain strength and mobility.\n\nRisks include **infection**, **nerve damage**, and recurrence of the bunionette.\n\nAccording to Wolters Kluwer Technology [data](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/news/after-bunion-surgery-immediate-x-rays-predict-recurrence-risk), the recurrence rate of tailor's bunions after surgery is around 5-10%, with some studies suggesting up to **25%** over a patient's lifetime​.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
