According to [Delta Dental](https://www.deltadental.com/us/en/protect-my-smile/procedures/root-canal/pain-and-recovery.html#:~:text=Pain%20after%20a%20root%20canal,the%20days%20following%20the%20procedure), **3 to 6 percent of people** treated with a root canal experience what they classify as \"severe pain\" in the days following the procedure.\n\nUnderstanding the causes of pain, its duration, and effective home treatments can help manage this discomfort.\n\nContents\n\n- [Causes of Pain After Root Canal](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/navigating-pain-after-root-canal#causes-of-pain-after-root-canal)\n- [How Long is Pain After Root Canal?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/navigating-pain-after-root-canal#how-long-is-pain-after-root-canal)\n- [How to Stop Throbbing Pain After Root Canal?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/navigating-pain-after-root-canal#how-to-stop-throbbing-pain-after-root-canal)\n\n## Causes of Pain After Root Canal\n\nA root canal is a dental procedure designed to **treat infection in the pulp** of a tooth. This treatment can save the tooth and prevent further complications.\n\nPain after a root canal can be due to:\n\n- **Inflammation** in the area surrounding the treated tooth.\n- **Infection** that persists or develops after the procedure.\n- The **natural healing process** causing temporary discomfort.\n- **Sensitivity** in the tissues around the treated tooth.\n\nComplications such as **residual infection**, a **cracked tooth**, or an **incomplete procedure** can cause pain.\n\nAnother possibility is an **[allergic reaction](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/allergy-attack)** to the materials used.\n\nIf pain is severe or persistent, it may indicate a problem. Observing symptoms like swelling, [fever](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/when-to-go-to-the-hospital-for-fever), or a bad taste in the mouth can help identify the cause.\n\n## How Long is Pain After Root Canal?\n\nPain after a root canal usually lasts a **few days**. It should gradually decrease as the tooth and surrounding tissue heal.\n\n**Factors that influence the length** of recovery time:\n\n- Severity of the initial infection.\n- Complexity of the root canal procedure.\n- Overall health and healing capacity of the patient.\n\nSome people may experience pain for a shorter or longer time depending on their **pain tolerance** and **healing response**.\n\nIf the pain lasts **longer than a week** or becomes more intense, consult your dentist. They may need to re-evaluate the treated tooth for any issues.\n\n## How to Stop Throbbing Pain After Root Canal?\n\n**Common home remedies for managing root canal pain**:\n\n- Apply a cold compress to the outside of your cheek near the affected area.\n- Rinse your mouth with warm salt water to reduce inflammation and pain.\n\nFollow any medication advice given by your dentist to manage pain effectively.\n\n**Recommended lifestyle changes to manage pain**:\n\n- Avoid chewing on the side of your mouth where the procedure was done.\n- Stick to soft foods and avoid very hot or cold items.\n\n**When to seek professional dental help**:\n\n- If the throbbing pain is severe and doesn't improve after a few days.\n- If you experience swelling, fever, or an unpleasant taste in your mouth.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
