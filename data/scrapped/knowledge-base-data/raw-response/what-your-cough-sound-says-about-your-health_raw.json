This type of cough can sound rough and grating and might be accompanied by a tightness in the chest or throat.\n\n## What Does a Lisinopril Cough Sound Like?\n\nA lisinopril cough is typically **dry** and **non-productive**, meaning it does not produce mucus.\n\nIt often **manifests as a persistent**, **tickling sensation deep in the throat**, leading to frequent and uncontrollable coughing spells.\n\nThe sound is usually **soft** and **repetitive**, but it can become more pronounced and bothersome over time.\n\nThis type of cough is distinctive because it starts shortly after beginning the medication and can last as long as the medication is used. According to the [AARP](https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/info-2024/chronic-cough-ace-inhibitors.html#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20lisinopril%20cough,after%20starting%20an%20ACE%20inhibitor.), symptoms usually appear within the **first two weeks to a month** after starting a lisinopril (ACE inhibitor).\n\n## What Does a COVID Cough Sound Like?\n\nA [COVID](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/sore-throat-covid) cough is usually **dry** and **persistent**, producing a **frequent**, **hacking sound without mucus**.\n\nIt can be **deep** and **throaty**, often accompanied by a feeling of tightness in the chest.\n\nThe cough tends to be **continuous** and can **worsen over time**, becoming more pronounced and tiring for the individual.\n\nIn some cases, it might start as a mild irritation but progressively intensifies, making it hard to ignore.\n\n## What Does a Bronchitis Cough Sound Like?\n\nA bronchitis cough typically sounds **wet** and **productive**, meaning it brings up mucus.\n\nIt can be **deep** and **rattling**, often accompanied by a **wheezing** or **whistling** sound when breathing.\n\nThe cough is **persistent** and can **worsen at night** or **in the early morning**.\n\nIt can produce thick, discolored phlegm and may be accompanied by a sensation of tightness or heaviness in the chest.\n\nThis type of cough can sound particularly harsh and exhausting.\n\n## What Does a Pneumonia Cough Sound Like?\n\nA pneumonia cough is usually **wet** and **productive**, characterized by a **deep**, **rattling sound** that brings up mucus.\n\nThe cough can be forceful and may produce thick, green, yellow, or even bloody sputum.\n\nIt often sounds **harsh** and is accompanied by **chest pain**, especially when coughing or taking a deep breath.\n\nThis type of cough can be severe and persistent, often accompanied by symptoms such as [**fever**](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/when-to-go-to-the-hospital-for-fever), **chills**, and **shortness of breath**.\n\n## What Does a Croup Cough Sound Like?\n\nA croup cough is **distinctive**, producing a **loud**, **barking sound** that resembles a seal's bark. It often starts **suddenly** and can be more pronounced **at night**.\n\nThe cough is typically **high-pitched** and may be accompanied by a **stridor**, which is a harsh, wheezing noise when breathing in.\n\nIt can be frightening due to its sudden onset and loud, brassy sound.\n\nThe cough is often accompanied by difficulty breathing and a hoarse voice, making it easy to identify.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
