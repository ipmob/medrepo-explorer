It can cause a variety of symptoms that impact daily life. PCOS can lead to dark inner thighs due to hormonal imbalances and insulin resistance.\n\nThese conditions **increase melanin production**, causing skin darkening. Common symptoms of PCOS include irregular periods, excessive hair growth, weight gain, and [acne](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/pcos-acne). Darkening of the skin, especially in areas like the inner thighs, is also frequently observed.\n\n## Why does PCOS cause hyperpigmentation?\n\nAccording to a Guide to Hormonal Dermatology [publication](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-99-7715-4_9#citeas), PCOS is a complex condition affecting multiple systems and causing various skin changes, which can distress patients. These skin conditions may include **hypo** or **hyperpigmentation** due to associated **metabolic disorders**.\n\nHyperpigmentation is a condition where certain areas of the **skin become darker** than the surrounding skin due to excess melanin production. PCOS leads to hormonal changes that can cause hyperpigmentation. Increased levels of **insulin and androgens** contribute to skin darkening.\n\n**Insulin resistance**, common in PCOS, causes higher insulin levels in the blood. This stimulates the skin cells to produce more melanin, leading to hyperpigmentation. Hormonal imbalances further exacerbate this effect, causing dark patches on the skin.\n\n## How else does PCOS affect the skin?\n\nAccording to [Harvard Health](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/polycystic-ovarian-syndrome-and-the-skin-202104292552) PCOS can affect the skin the following ways:\n\n**PCOS-related acne**:\n\n- Often appears on the lower face, jawline, chin, and upper neck.\n- Acne lesions tend to be deeper, larger, and slower to resolve.\n- Acne worsens around menstrual periods.\n- [Oral contraceptive pills](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/iud-vs-pill) and certain medications are often recommended for treatment.\n\n**Hirsutism (excessive hair growth)**:\n\n- Common areas include the chin, neck, abdomen, chest, and back.\n- Scalp may experience balding or thinning.\n- Driven by excess testosterone.\n\n**Acanthosis nigricans**:\n\n- Dark, velvety skin patches in creases like the neck and underarms.\n- Associated with insulin resistance.\n- Caused by stimulation of skin cells by insulin.\n\n## What Else Can Cause Inner Thigh Darkening?\n\nInner thigh darkening can be caused by several factors other than PCOS:\n\n- **Friction**: Tight clothing or excessive skin rubbing can lead to darkening.\n- **Obesity**: Increased skin friction due to excess weight.\n- **Medications**: Certain medications can contribute to hyperpigmentation.\n- **Hormonal changes**: Changes during pregnancy or menopause can cause skin darkening.\n- **Poor hygiene**: Poor hygiene and excessive sweating can lead to dark inner thighs.\n- **Skin conditions**: Conditions like eczema or fungal infections can also cause discoloration.\n\n## How to treat dark inner thighs?\n\n- **Maintain a healthy weight**: Reduces skin friction and prevents darkening.\n- **Wear loose, breathable clothing**: Minimizes friction and allows the skin to breathe.\n- **Regular exfoliation**: Removes dead skin cells and lightens dark areas.\n- **Use moisturizers**: Natural ingredients can keep the skin hydrated and reduce darkening.\n- **Topical treatments**: Products with vitamin C or alpha hydroxy acids can lighten the skin.\n- **Avoid excessive sun exposure**: Use sunscreen to prevent further darkening.\n- **Seek professional advice**: If home remedies don’t work, consult a dermatologist for effective treatments.\n\n## Other PCOS Symptoms to Look Out for\n\nPCOS can cause a variety of symptoms that affect women differently. Besides dark inner thighs, other common symptoms include:\n\n- [**Irregular periods**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/8-types-of-abnormal-menstruation): Menstrual cycles can be infrequent, prolonged, or completely absent.\n- **Excessive hair growth**: Areas like the face, chest, and back may experience unwanted hair growth.\n- **Weight gain**: Many women with PCOS struggle with weight gain and difficulty losing weight.\n- **Acne**: Hormonal imbalances can lead to severe acne, particularly on the face, chest, and back.\n- **Hair thinning**: Some women experience thinning hair or hair loss on the scalp.\n- **Fertility issues**: PCOS is a leading cause of infertility due to irregular ovulation.\n- **Skin tags and acanthosis nigricans**: Small skin growths and darkened skin patches, especially in body folds, can also occur.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
