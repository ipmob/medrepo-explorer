The pain can last from a few days to several weeks, depending on factors like the tooth's position and available space in the mouth.\n\nThis pain often comes and goes due to the intermittent eruption process, with triggers such as chewing hard foods and poor oral hygiene.\n\nContents\n\n- [How long does the pain from a growing wisdom tooth last?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/strategies-for-wisdom-tooth-growing-pain#how-long-does-the-pain-from-a-growing-wisdom-tooth-last)\n- [Why does wisdom tooth pain come and go?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/strategies-for-wisdom-tooth-growing-pain#why-does-wisdom-tooth-pain-come-and-go)\n- [How to deal with wisdom tooth pain?](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/strategies-for-wisdom-tooth-growing-pain#how-to-deal-with-wisdom-tooth-pain)\n\n## How long does the pain from a growing wisdom tooth last?\n\nWisdom teeth are the last to emerge, located at the back of the mouth. They typically appear between the ages of **17 and 25**, though they can also come in much later, according to the Oral Health Foundation [article](https://www.dentalhealth.org/wisdom-teeth).\n\n[The pain from a growing](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/coping-with-wisdom-tooth-growing-pain) wisdom tooth usually lasts a few days to a few weeks. For some people, the discomfort is brief, lasting only a few days as the tooth breaks through the gum. Others might experience pain for weeks, especially if there isn't enough space in the mouth for the new tooth.\n\nSeveral factors can influence how long the pain lasts, including:\n\n- **Tooth position**: The angle at which the tooth is growing.\n- **Available space**: Whether there is enough room in the mouth for the new tooth.\n- **Impaction**: Impacted wisdom teeth trapped beneath the gum or jawbone can cause prolonged discomfort.\n- **Pressure on other teeth**: A wisdom tooth growing at an angle and pressing against other teeth can extend the duration of pain.\n\nIf the pain lasts more than a few weeks or becomes severe, it's important to seek professional advice. Persistent or intense pain might indicate complications such as infection or impaction that require dental intervention.\n\n## Why does wisdom tooth pain come and go?\n\n[Wisdom tooth pain](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/wisdom-tooth-pain-relief-tips-and-solutions) often comes and goes because the tooth's eruption process is intermittent. As the tooth gradually emerges through the gum, it creates periods of pressure and discomfort. This process doesn't happen all at once, leading to alternating phases of pain and relief.\n\nCommon triggers for pain episodes include:\n\n- **[Chewing](https://docus.ai/knowledge-base/understanding-ear-and-tooth-pain-when-chewing) hard foods**: This can irritate the gum tissue around the emerging tooth.\n- **Poor oral hygiene**: Allows food particles and bacteria to accumulate around the partially erupted tooth, leading to inflammation and pain.\n\nMonitoring your symptoms is important. Note any changes in the frequency, intensity, or triggers of the pain. If the pain becomes frequent or intense, consult a dentist. They can help identify any underlying issues, such as infection or impaction, that may require treatment.\n\n## How to deal with wisdom tooth pain?\n\nTo deal with wisdom tooth pain, try several home remedies and maintain good oral hygiene practices:\n\n- **Cold compress**: Apply to the affected area to reduce swelling and numb the pain.\n- **Warm salt water rinse**: Helps keep the area clean and reduce inflammation.\n- **Good oral hygiene**: Brush and floss regularly to remove food particles and plaque from around the wisdom tooth.\n- **Avoid hard or sticky foods**: Prevent further irritation to the gum.\n\nIf home remedies don't alleviate the pain, or if the pain persists or worsens, consult a dentist. They can provide a thorough evaluation and recommend appropriate treatments, which may include:\n\n- Professional cleaning\n- Antibiotics for infection\n- Extraction of the wisdom tooth if necessary.\n\n![AI Assistant](https://docus.ai/images/small-assistant.png)\n\n### Have Questions?\n\nHave a question on this topic?
