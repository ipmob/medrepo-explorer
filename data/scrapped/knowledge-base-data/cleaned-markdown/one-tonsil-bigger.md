## Is It Normal for One Tonsil to Be Bigger Than the Other?

It is **relatively common** for one tonsil to be slightly larger than the other. Just like other parts of the body, tonsils can differ in size. This asymmetry is usually not a cause for concern and can occur naturally.

Here are a few common causes:

- **Infections**: WebMD  like strep throat can cause one tonsil to swell more.
