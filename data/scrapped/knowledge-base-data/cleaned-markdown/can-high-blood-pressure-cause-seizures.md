# Can High Blood Pressure Trigger Seizures? Signs and Risks

High blood pressure is a serious condition, but can it cause seizures?

If you or a loved one has experienced seizure-like symptoms and also has high blood pressure, it's natural to wonder if the two are connected.

While seizures are commonly linked to epilepsy, high blood pressure can also trigger them in severe cases.

## Can high blood pressure cause seizures?

Yes, but only in severe cases.

High blood pressure alone does not typically cause seizures.

High blood pressure alone **does not usually cause seizures**.

However, when blood pressure rises to dangerous levels—above **180/120 mmHg**—it can lead to [**hypertensive encephalopathy**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554499/).

This is a medical emergency where high pressure causes **swelling in the brain**. This may lead to **neurological symptoms, including seizures**.

Uncontrolled high blood pressure also increases the risk of **stroke**, which can **damage brain tissue and trigger seizures**.

## How are these seizures different from epilepsy?

Epilepsy is a **chronic neurological disorder** where seizures happen due to **abnormal electrical activity in the brain**.

Seizures caused by **high blood pressure** are different because:

- They occur **due to extreme hypertension**, not irregular brain signals.
- They are **temporary** and usually stop once blood pressure is lowered.
- They do **not mean a person has epilepsy** but still require medical attention.

If someone with high blood pressure has a seizure, they should **see a doctor immediately** to rule out serious complications.

## What are the symptoms of a seizure from high blood pressure?

A seizure caused by high blood pressure often happens when the condition reaches a **crisis level**. Before a seizure, a person may show warning signs such as:

- **Severe headache** that doesn’t go away
- **Blurred or double vision**
- **Confusion or trouble thinking**
- **Nausea or vomiting**
- **Shortness of breath**
- **Sudden loss of consciousness**

If you or someone you know has **high blood pressure and these symptoms**, **seek emergency medical care immediately**.

Ignoring these signs can lead to life-threatening complications.

## Who is at risk of high blood pressure-related seizures?

Not everyone with high blood pressure is at risk of seizures.

However, certain people are more vulnerable, including:

- **People with uncontrolled hypertension** – Chronic high blood pressure increases the risk of complications.
- **Those in a hypertensive crisis** – Blood pressure above **180/120 mmHg** can cause brain swelling and seizures.
- **Individuals with kidney disease** – The kidneys help control blood pressure, and damage to them can worsen hypertension.
- **Stroke survivors** – A past stroke can make the brain more sensitive to sudden blood pressure changes.
- **Pregnant women with preeclampsia or eclampsia** – These conditions cause **dangerously high blood pressure and seizures**.
- **People with epilepsy** – While epilepsy and high blood pressure seizures are different, some [research](https://aepi.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42494-024-00152-9) suggests **hypertension can make seizure control harder**.

If you are at risk, **monitor your blood pressure regularly** and follow medical advice to prevent dangerous spikes.

## What to do if someone has a seizure due to high blood pressure?

Seizures can be alarming, but staying calm and taking quick action can make all the difference. Here’s what to do:

1. **Call 911 or emergency services immediately** – This is a life-threatening situation.
2. **Lay the person on their side** – This helps prevent choking if they vomit.
3. **Do not put anything in their mouth** – Contrary to popular belief, people do not swallow their tongues during seizures. Inserting objects can cause injury.
4. **Do not try to hold them down** – Let the seizure run its course. Restraining them can cause harm.
5. **Check their breathing** – If they stop breathing after the seizure, start **CPR** until medical help arrives.
6. **Stay with them** – After the seizure, they may be confused. Keep them calm and reassure them until medical professionals take over.
