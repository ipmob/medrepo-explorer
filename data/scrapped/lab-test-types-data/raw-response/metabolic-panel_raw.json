Metabolism refers to the chemical processes that occur within your body to maintain life, including the conversion of food into energy, the balance of fluids and electrolytes, and the functioning of your organs like the liver and kidneys.\n\nBy analyzing specific substances in your blood, a metabolic panel helps healthcare providers assess how well your organs are working and detect potential health issues early.\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## Types of Metabolic Panels (BMP and CMP)\n\nThere are two main types of metabolic panels: the **Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP)** and the **Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)**. Each type serves distinct purposes and includes different tests, depending on what your healthcare provider needs to evaluate.\n\n- **Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP)**: The BMP is a more focused set of tests that primarily looks at your body's electrolyte balance, blood sugar [(glucose)](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/glucose) levels, and kidney function. It includes eight key tests and is often used in routine checkups to monitor your overall health or to investigate specific symptoms.\n- **Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)**: The CMP includes all the tests in the BMP but adds several more to provide a broader picture of your health. In addition to the BMP's tests, the CMP assesses liver function and protein levels, offering insights into your liver's health and overall nutritional status. This makes the CMP a more thorough examination, often used when more detailed information is required.\n\nBoth panels are essential in modern healthcare, guiding doctors in diagnosing diseases, monitoring ongoing conditions, and ensuring that treatments are effective without causing harm. Choosing between a BMP and a CMP depends on your specific health needs, as determined by your healthcare provider.\n\n### Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP)\n\nA **Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP)** is a set of **8 blood tests** that measure different substances in your blood, each reflecting an aspect of your health. The BMP is often part of routine health assessments, providing a snapshot of your body's chemical balance and kidney function.\n\nThese tests help your healthcare provider evaluate your electrolyte levels, blood sugar, and how well your kidneys are filtering waste.\n\n#### Components of BMP\n\nThe BMP includes the following components, each playing a crucial role in maintaining your body's overall health:\n\n- [**Glucose**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/glucose): This is a type of sugar that serves as the primary source of energy for your body. Measuring glucose levels in your blood can help diagnose diabetes or monitor how well you are managing your blood sugar if you already have diabetes.\n- [**Calcium**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/calcium): Calcium is a vital mineral for strong bones and teeth, but it also plays a crucial role in muscle function, nerve transmission, and blood clotting. Abnormal calcium levels can indicate issues such as bone disease, kidney problems, or thyroid dysfunction.\n- [**Sodium**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/sodium): Sodium is an electrolyte that helps regulate the amount of fluid in your body, maintain proper nerve and muscle function, and balance your body’s pH levels. High or low sodium levels could signal dehydration, kidney disease, or other health concerns.\n- [**Potassium**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/potassium): This electrolyte is essential for heart and muscle function. Potassium levels that are too high or too low can be dangerous, potentially leading to heart problems or muscle weakness. It's especially important to monitor in people with kidney disease or those on certain medications.\n- [**Chloride**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/chloride): Chloride works with sodium and potassium to help maintain proper fluid balance and acid-base balance in your body. Abnormal chloride levels may indicate dehydration, kidney disease, or problems with your body's acid-base balance.\n- **Bicarbonate (CO2)**: Bicarbonate helps regulate the pH level of your blood, ensuring that it doesn’t become too acidic or too alkaline. Monitoring bicarbonate levels can help detect respiratory issues, kidney problems, or metabolic conditions.\n- [**BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen)**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/blood-urea-nitrogen): BUN measures the amount of nitrogen in your blood that comes from [urea](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/urea), a waste product produced by your liver and removed by your kidneys. High BUN levels can indicate kidney dysfunction, dehydration, or heart failure.\n- [**Creatinine**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/creatinine-key-insights): Creatinine is another waste product filtered by your kidneys. Elevated creatinine levels typically suggest kidney problems, as your kidneys may not be effectively filtering it out of your blood.\n\nThe Basic Metabolic Panel is a fundamental tool in understanding your overall health, providing critical information that can help detect and manage a wide range of conditions. Regular monitoring through a BMP can guide you and your healthcare provider in making informed decisions about your health and lifestyle.\n\n### Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)\n\nA **Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)** is an expanded version of the Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP) and includes all the tests found in the BMP, plus additional tests that provide more detailed information about your body's overall health.\n\nSpecifically, the CMP adds tests that evaluate liver function and protein levels in your blood, offering a more thorough assessment of your metabolic and organ health. This panel is often used in both routine checkups and more detailed diagnostic procedures.\n\n#### Components of CMP\n\nThe CMP includes the same eight tests as the BMP, with additional tests that give insight into liver health and protein levels.\n\nIn addition to these BMP tests, the CMP includes:\n\n- [**Albumin**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/albumin): Albumin is the most abundant protein in your blood, playing a key role in maintaining fluid balance. Low levels of albumin can indicate liver disease, kidney disease, or malnutrition.\n- [**Total Protein**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/total-protein): This test measures the total amount of protein in your blood, including albumin and [globulins](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/globulin). Abnormal protein levels can indicate liver or kidney disease, as well as other conditions that affect protein production or loss.\n- [**ALP (Alkaline Phosphatase)**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/alkaline-phosphatase-alp): ALP is an enzyme found in various tissues, with the highest concentrations in the liver, bones, kidneys, and bile ducts. Elevated ALP levels can indicate liver disease, bone disorders, or bile duct blockages.\n- [**ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase)**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/alt): ALT is an enzyme primarily found in the liver. High levels of ALT in the blood can indicate liver damage or inflammation, often caused by conditions like hepatitis or cirrhosis.\n- [**AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase)**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/ast-blood-test): Like ALT, AST is an enzyme found in the liver and heart. Elevated AST levels can also indicate liver damage or other conditions affecting the liver or muscles.\n- [**Bilirubin**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/bilirubin): Bilirubin is a waste product from the breakdown of red blood cells. The liver processes bilirubin, and high levels in the blood can indicate liver problems, bile duct blockages, or hemolytic anemia.\n\nBy including these additional tests, the CMP provides a more complete picture of your health, particularly in areas related to liver function and protein balance. This comprehensive approach allows healthcare providers to better diagnose and manage a variety of conditions, ensuring that any potential issues are identified and addressed promptly.\n\n## Why Are Metabolic Panels Ordered?\n\nMetabolic panels, including both the CMP and BMP, are integral tools in healthcare, used to monitor and maintain your overall health. They provide essential information that can guide your healthcare provider in making informed decisions about your care. Here’s why these panels are commonly ordered:\n\n### Routine Health Checkups\n\nBoth the CMP and BMP are frequently used during routine health screenings. During these checkups, your healthcare provider might order a metabolic panel to get a snapshot of your general health. These tests can detect potential issues before symptoms arise, making them a key component of preventive care.\n\nRegularly checking your metabolic panel can help identify imbalances in electrolytes, blood sugar levels, and kidney function, allowing you and your provider to take action early and maintain good health.\n\n### Diagnosing Conditions\n\nMetabolic panels are also crucial for diagnosing a variety of health conditions. The tests included in the CMP and BMP can help your healthcare provider detect:\n\n- [**Diabetes**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/diabetes): By measuring glucose levels, these panels can identify high blood sugar, which is a primary indicator of diabetes. According to [WHO](https://www.who.int/health-topics/diabetes#tab=tab_1), it affects about **422 million** people worldwide.\n- [**Liver Disease**](https://docus.ai/tags/liver): The CMP includes liver function tests that can reveal liver damage or inflammation, which may be caused by conditions like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis, which affects about **4.5 million** adults over 18 years old, as per the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/liver-disease.htm). Early identification of liver dysfunction through a CMP can prevent the progression of these diseases\n- [**Kidney Disease**](https://docus.ai/tags/kidney-diseases): Both panels assess kidney function through BUN and creatinine levels. Elevated levels may indicate that your kidneys are not filtering waste effectively, which could be a sign of kidney disease. The National Kidney Foundation [states](https://www.kidney.org/press-room/37-million-american-adults-now-estimated-to-have-chronic-kidney-disease#:~:text=New%20York%2C%20NY%20%E2%80%93%20July%2017,Control%20and%20Prevention%20(CDC).) that **37 million Americans** have chronic kidney disease, with many more at risk due to conditions like diabetes and hypertension.\n- **Electrolyte Imbalances**: Abnormal levels of electrolytes like sodium, potassium, and chloride can indicate dehydration, heart issues, or other underlying conditions that need to be addressed. [Studies](https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9073886/) suggest that up to **20%** of hospitalized patients experience some form of electrolyte imbalance, making these tests vital for diagnosis and treatment.\n\nThese diagnostic capabilities make metabolic panels an invaluable tool in detecting and managing health issues before they become more serious.\n\n### Monitoring Treatment\n\nIf you have a chronic condition like diabetes or kidney disease, metabolic panels are crucial for monitoring your treatment’s effectiveness. These tests help your healthcare provider ensure your treatment is working or if adjustments are needed. Regular panels can also detect if medications are affecting your liver or kidneys, helping to prevent complications. By monitoring these levels, you can manage your health condition more effectively and work with your provider to maintain your overall well-being.\n\n### Symptoms Leading to a Metabolic Panel\n\nA metabolic panel may be prescribed if you're experiencing symptoms that suggest an imbalance in your body's chemical processes or potential issues with your liver, kidneys, or blood sugar levels. Common symptoms that could prompt your healthcare provider to order this test include:\n\n- [**Fatigue**](https://docus.ai/tags/fatigue): Persistent tiredness that doesn't improve with rest could indicate issues with your metabolism, liver, or kidneys.\n- **Frequent Urination and Thirst**: These symptoms might be signs of high blood sugar levels, potentially pointing to [diabetes](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/diabetes).\n- **Swelling or Edema**: Swelling in your legs, feet, or other parts of your body can suggest [kidney problems](https://docus.ai/tags/kidney-diseases) or electrolyte imbalances.\n- **Unexplained** [**Weight Loss**](https://docus.ai/tags/weight-loss): Sudden, unintentional weight loss may be related to metabolic issues, diabetes, or [liver disease](https://docus.ai/tags/liver).\n- [**Abdominal Pain**](https://docus.ai/tags/abdominal-pain) **or Jaundice**: Pain in the abdomen, especially if accompanied by yellowing of the skin or eyes, could indicate liver dysfunction.\n\nIf you're experiencing any of these symptoms, a metabolic panel can provide valuable insights into the underlying causes and guide your healthcare provider in diagnosing and managing your condition.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Docus AI Symptom Checker\n\nJust 3 simple steps to efficiently understand and manage your health symptoms online.\n\n[Try Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/symptom-checker)\n\n## How to Prepare for a Metabolic Panel\n\nProper preparation is important because it helps avoid any factors that could skew the results, leading to a more accurate assessment of your health. Here’s how you can prepare effectively:\n\n- **Fasting Requirements:** Before a metabolic panel, fasting for 8 to 12 hours is often required, especially for accurate glucose measurement. During this time, only water is allowed to prevent recent food or drink intake from affecting blood sugar and other components like lipids and electrolytes.\n- **Medication Considerations:** Medications can impact test results, so inform your healthcare provider about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements. Your provider may advise pausing certain medications before the test but always consult them before stopping any medication.\n\n## Normal Ranges for Metabolic Panel Tests\n\n| Biomarker | Normal Range | Unit of Measurement |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [Glucose](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/glucose) | 70 to 99 | mg/dL |\n| [Calcium](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/calcium) | 8.6 to 10.2 | mg/dL |\n| Sodium | 136 to 145 | mEq/L |\n| Potassium | 3.5 to 5.0 | mEq/L |\n| Chloride | 98 to 106 | mmol/L |\n| Bicarbonate (CO2) | 23 to 30 | mmol/L |\n| BUN<br> (Blood Urea Nitrogen) | 8 to 20 | mg/dL |\n| [Creatinine](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/creatinine-key-insights) | 0.5 to 1.1 (females),<br> 0.7 to 1.3 (males) | mg/dL |\n| [Albumin](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/albumin) | 3.5 to 5.5 | g/dL |\n| Total Protein | 5.5 to 9.0 | g/dL |\n| ALP<br> (Alkaline Phosphatase) | 30 to 120 | IU/L |\n| [ALT\\<br>\\<br> (Alanine Aminotransferase)](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/alt) | 10 to 40 | IU/L |\n| [AST\\<br>\\<br> (Aspartate Aminotransferase)](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/ast-blood-test) | 10 to 40 | IU/L |\n| [Total Bilirubin](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/bilirubin) | 0.3 to 1.0 | mg/dL |\n\n**Note**: _The units of measurement and the normal ranges can differ depending on the laboratory and the specific methods used._\n\n## Interpreting Metabolic Panel Results\n\nIt’s important to note that normal ranges can vary slightly depending on factors like age, sex, and the laboratory that conducted the test. Therefore, it’s essential to consult your healthcare provider for a detailed explanation of your results. They can interpret the findings in the context of your overall health, medical history, and any symptoms you may be experiencing.\n\nIf any of your results fall outside the normal range, your provider may recommend further testing or specific lifestyle changes to address the issue. It’s crucial to discuss these results with your provider to fully understand what they mean for your health.\n\n### Abnormal Results\n\n- **Glucose**: Elevated glucose levels can suggest diabetes or pre-diabetes. If your glucose is higher than normal, your provider may recommend additional tests, such as a fasting blood sugar test or an A1C test, to confirm a diagnosis of diabetes.\n- **Calcium**: Abnormal calcium levels can indicate a variety of conditions. Low calcium might be due to nutritional deficiencies, kidney disease, or issues with parathyroid glands. High calcium levels could suggest hyperparathyroidism, certain cancers, or excessive vitamin D intake.\n- **Liver Enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP)**: High levels of these liver enzymes might indicate liver damage or inflammation, often caused by conditions like hepatitis or cirrhosis. These enzymes are released into the blood when the liver is damaged.\n- **BUN and Creatinine**: These results provide insight into kidney function. High levels of BUN and creatinine can suggest that your kidneys are not filtering waste effectively, which may be a sign of kidney disease or dehydration.\n- **Albumin and Total Protein**: Low levels of these proteins might indicate liver disease, kidney disease, or malnutrition. If your albumin or total protein levels are abnormal, your provider will investigate the underlying cause and suggest appropriate interventions.\n- **Sodium**: Low sodium levels, known as hyponatremia, can suggest conditions like kidney disease, heart failure, or excessive water intake. High sodium levels, or hypernatremia, might indicate dehydration or kidney dysfunction.\n- **Potassium**: Low potassium levels (hypokalemia) may result from conditions like excessive vomiting, diarrhea, or the use of diuretics, leading to symptoms like muscle weakness or heart arrhythmias. High potassium levels (hyperkalemia) could suggest kidney disease or certain medications, which could cause dangerous heart arrhythmias.\n- **Chloride**: Low chloride levels might be due to dehydration, chronic lung disease, or prolonged vomiting, while high chloride levels can indicate dehydration, kidney disease, or an overproduction of stomach acid.\n- **Bicarbonate (CO2)**: Low bicarbonate levels can indicate metabolic acidosis, a condition where the body is too acidic, possibly due to kidney disease or diabetic ketoacidosis. High bicarbonate levels suggest metabolic alkalosis, where the body is too alkaline, often due to prolonged vomiting or lung diseases.\n- **Bilirubin**: Elevated bilirubin levels can indicate liver problems such as hepatitis or cirrhosis, or issues like bile duct blockages. It can also suggest hemolytic anemia, where red blood cells break down too quickly.\n\nWhile your healthcare provider is the best resource for a detailed explanation, you can additionally [**upload your test results**](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation/blood-test) to the Docus Interpretation Tool for quick and easy-to-understand insights into your blood test results.
