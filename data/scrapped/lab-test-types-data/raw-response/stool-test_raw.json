Common signs include:\n\n- Blood in stool, visible or hidden.\n- Persistent diarrhea or ongoing constipation.\n- Abdominal pain or cramping that does not go away.\n- Unexplained weight loss or ongoing fatigue.\n- [Bowel leakage](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/bowel-leakage-cancer-sign#diagnostic-tests) or difficulty controlling bowel movements.\n\nThese symptoms often signal underlying health problems that need investigation.\n\n### Conditions Stool Tests Detect\n\nStool tests help identify a variety of gastrointestinal and digestive conditions, including:\n\n- [**Hemorrhoids and Anal Fissures**](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/anal-fissure-vs-hemorrhoids) **:** Swollen veins or small tears in the anus that can cause pain, discomfort, or bleeding.\n- **Colorectal cancer:** Early detection of cancer or precancerous polyps in the colon or rectum.\n- **Diverticulosis:** Small bulging pockets in the intestinal wall that can cause discomfort or infection.\n- **Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD):** Chronic inflammation in the digestive tract, including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.\n- **Gastrointestinal infections:** Bacteria, viruses, or parasites can cause diarrhea, fever, and stomach pain.\n- **Steatorrhea:** Excess fat in the stool, often linked to malabsorption or pancreatic issues.\n- **Gastrointestinal bleeding:** Hidden or visible blood in the stool, which can indicate ulcers, cancer, or inflammation.\n- **Stomach ulcers:** Stomach ulcers are open sores in the stomach lining that result from infections or other issues.\n- **Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency:** Inability to properly digest food due to a lack of pancreatic enzymes.\n- **Colitis:** Swelling or irritation of the colon, often linked to infections or autoimmune diseases.\n- **Anemia-related issues:** Hidden blood loss in the stool that can contribute to low [red blood cell](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/red-blood-cell-rbc) counts.\n\n## Types of Stool Tests\n\nStool tests help doctors find out what’s causing digestive problems or check for specific health conditions. Different types of stool tests are available, and your doctor will recommend the best one based on your symptoms.\n\n### Routine Stool Analysis\n\nA routine stool analysis examines the appearance, consistency, and composition of stool to identify digestive issues.\n\nThis test checks for abnormalities like **mucus**, **blood**, **pus**, or **undigested food**.\n\nIt also evaluates **stool color** and **pH levels**, which can provide clues about infections, malabsorption, or other gastrointestinal disorders.\n\nRoutine stool analysis is often the first step when diagnosing digestive problems.\n\n### Screening for Blood\n\nSome stool tests check for hidden blood, which can be a sign of bleeding in the digestive system or colorectal cancer.\n\n#### Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT)\n\nThis test looks for blood in the stool that you can’t see. You place a small stool sample on a special card, and a chemical is added. If the card changes color, it means there might be blood.\n\nBefore this test, you might need to avoid certain foods like **red meat**, **broccoli**, and **turnips** to ensure accurate results. Medications such as **aspirin**, **NSAIDs**, or **vitamin C supplements** may also be avoided.\n\n#### Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT)\n\nFIT also looks for hidden blood, but it uses antibodies that specifically detect human blood.\n\nUnlike FOBT, there are no dietary restrictions, and it’s easier to prepare. This test is often more accurate because it focuses on blood from the lower digestive system, like the colon or rectum.\n\n### Detecting Infections\n\nThese tests determine if an infection causes diarrhea, stomach pain, or fever.\n\n#### Stool culture for bacteria\n\nThis test checks for harmful bacteria, like **Salmonella** or **E. coli**, that shouldn’t be in your digestive system.\n\nThe stool sample is placed in a lab to see if bacteria grow. If bacteria are found, doctors can figure out which antibiotics might work best.\n\n#### Ova and Parasite (O&P) test\n\nThis test checks for **eggs**(ova) and **parasites** in the stool. It is often used for long-term diarrhea or after travel to areas with common parasitic infections, such as Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, or Central America.\n\nThe lab examines the stool under a microscope to detect parasites like **Giardia lamblia** or **Entamoeba histolytica**.\n\n#### Tests for specific pathogens\n\nSome tests are designed to look for specific infections. For example, a stool test can find **Helicobacter pylori**, a type of bacteria that causes stomach ulcers and may increase the risk of stomach cancer.\n\n### Specialized Tests\n\n#### Fecal fat test for malabsorption\n\nThis test checks for extra fat in your stool, which can mean your body isn’t absorbing nutrients properly. It’s often done if you have greasy stools, weight loss, or other symptoms of malabsorption.\n\n#### Calprotectin and lactoferrin tests\n\nThese tests check for inflammation in your digestive system and help diagnose or monitor conditions like **Crohn’s disease** and **ulcerative colitis**.\n\n**[Calprotectin](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/calprotectin)** is a protein released during intestinal inflammation. High levels can indicate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), like Crohn’s or ulcerative colitis. This test also helps track how well treatments are working.\n\n**Lactoferrin** is another marker of inflammation. It shows how active the inflammation is and helps doctors decide if further tests, like a colonoscopy, are needed.\n\nBoth tests use a stool sample to detect inflammation and track treatment progress.\n\n#### DNA stool tests for cancer detection\n\nThese advanced tests look for **abnormal DNA** in the stool that could be a sign of cancer or precancerous growths. They are highly sensitive and can find signs of colorectal cancer early, often before symptoms appear.\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## How to Prepare for a Stool Test\n\nProper preparation for a stool test ensures accurate results and avoids the need for a repeat test. Follow these simple recommendations before collecting your sample.\n\n### Pre-Test Instructions\n\nYour doctor may ask you to avoid certain foods or medications that could affect the test.\n\nFor example, some tests require avoiding red meat, iron supplements, or certain medications like NSAIDs. Always follow the specific instructions provided.\n\nSome stool tests require a single sample, while others may need multiple samples collected over a few days. Check with your doctor or lab to understand how and when to collect your samples.\n\n### Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\nOne common mistake is **contaminating the stool sample with urine or water**. To prevent this, pee before collecting your stool and ensure the sample does not touch water from the toilet.\n\nAnother mistake is **storing the sample improperly**. Some samples need refrigeration, while others must stay at room temperature. Incorrect storage can ruin the sample and produce inaccurate results.\n\nAlways follow the storage instructions provided by your doctor or lab.\n\n## How to Collect a Stool Sample\n\nCollecting a stool sample may seem hard, but it’s simple with the right steps. Whether for yourself or a child, proper collection ensures reliable test results.\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions for Adults\n\n1. Get the supplies from your doctor or lab, like the container and scoop.\n2. Use a clean container or plastic wrap over the toilet to catch the stool. Don’t let it touch the toilet.\n3. Put a small amount of stool into the container using the scoop or a disposable spoon. Follow the size instructions.\n4. Close the container tightly to keep it clean and safe.\n5. Throw away any leftover stool and used items in a sealed bag.\n6. Wash your hands well with soap and water.\n\n### Special Considerations for Infants and Toddlers\n\nFor infants or toddlers, collecting a stool sample requires a slightly different approach. You can line the diaper with plastic wrap to prevent the stool from being absorbed into the diaper material.\n\nIf the child uses a potty, place a clean plastic container inside to catch the stool directly.\n\nTransfer some stool into the sample container using a clean scoop and seal it tightly. Follow your doctor’s storage instructions for accurate results.\n\n## Normal Stool Characteristics\n\nHealthy stool is usually brown, soft, and well-formed. It should not contain visible blood, mucus, or harmful pathogens.\n\nNormal results indicate that your digestive system is functioning properly, and no signs of infection, inflammation, or other issues were detected.\n\n## What Happens After Abnormal Results?\n\nIf your stool test results are abnormal, your doctor will recommend additional tests or treatments based on the findings.\n\nDoctors may recommend a **colonoscopy** or **CT scan** to examine the digestive tract and identify underlying issues. In some cases, [**blood tests**](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview) may be ordered to confirm or rule out specific conditions.\n\nTreatment depends on the cause of the abnormal results. For infections, doctors may prescribe medications for bacteria, parasites, or other pathogens.\n\nMalabsorption or inflammation may require dietary changes or supplements. In complex cases, like cancer or growths, doctors may refer you to a specialist.\n\nQuick follow-up is key to managing and resolving health issues effectively.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### \\#\\#\\# How accurate is a stool test for colon cancer?\n\nStool tests, like the FIT or DNA stool tests, are highly accurate for detecting early signs of colon cancer. These tests are effective at finding hidden blood or abnormal DNA linked to cancer or precancerous growths. However, they are screening tools and may require follow-up tests, such as a colonoscopy, for confirmation.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# How long does a stool test take?\n\nMost stool test results are ready within 1 to 3 days. However, certain tests, like stool cultures, may take longer (up to 5 days or more) as they involve growing bacteria or detecting specific pathogens.\n\n### \\#\\#\\# How much stool is needed for a calprotectin test?\n\nFor a calprotectin test, a small sample of stool is sufficient—typically about the size of a pea (5-10 grams). Follow the lab's instructions to ensure you provide the correct amount, as over- or under-filling the container can affect the accuracy of the test.\n\nHave more questions?
