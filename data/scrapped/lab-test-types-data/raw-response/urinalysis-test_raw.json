This test helps to identify and monitor a wide range of health conditions. During a urinalysis, a urine sample is collected and examined in three main ways: **visually**, **microscopically**, and **chemically**. Each of these examinations provides important information about your health.\n\nUrinalysis is used to detect conditions such as infections, kidney disease, liver disease, and [diabetes](https://docus.ai/symptoms-guide/diabetes). It can reveal a lot about your body's functioning by analyzing substances in your urine. Healthcare providers rely on urinalysis because it is non-invasive, quick, and can be performed easily in various settings, including clinics, hospitals, and even at home.\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## Why Is Urinalysis Done?\n\n### Routine Health Check-Ups\n\nUrinalysis is often part of routine health check-ups. During these check-ups, your doctor uses the urine test to screen for early signs of health issues that might not show symptoms yet.\n\n### Pre-Surgery Assessments\n\nBefore undergoing surgery, your doctor may order a urinalysis to ensure there are no underlying conditions that could complicate the procedure. This test helps identify any infections or other issues that need to be addressed to reduce risks during and after surgery.\n\n### Pregnancy Checkups\n\nUrinalysis is a common part of [pregnancy](https://docus.ai/tags/pregnancy) checkups. It helps monitor the health of both the mother and the developing baby. By checking for signs of conditions like **gestational diabetes** and **preeclampsia**, healthcare providers can take early steps to manage these conditions and ensure a healthy pregnancy.\n\n### Diagnosing and Monitoring Chronic Diseases\n\nUrinalysis plays a crucial role in diagnosing and monitoring chronic conditions such as kidney disease, liver disease, and [diabetes](https://docus.ai/tags/diabetes). For instance, high levels of protein in urine can indicate **kidney damage**, while abnormal glucose levels can signal **diabetes**. Regular urine tests help doctors track the progression of these diseases and adjust treatments accordingly.\n\n### Identifying Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)\n\nIf you have symptoms like **frequent urination**, **burning sensation while urinating**, or **cloudy urine**, your doctor may order a urinalysis to check for urinary tract infections ( [UTIs](https://docus.ai/tags/uti)). This test detects the presence of bacteria, white blood cells, and other indicators of infection, helping to diagnose and treat the UTI effectively.\n\n## How Does an Urinalysis Work?\n\n### Visual Examination\n\nThe first step in a urinalysis is the visual examination of your urine sample. A healthcare provider checks the **color**, **clarity**, and **odor** of the urine. Normal urine is usually **clear** and ranges from **pale yellow to deep amber**, depending on your hydration level.\n\nUnusual colors, such as red or dark brown, can indicate blood in the urine or other health issues. Cloudy urine may suggest an infection, while a strong odor can be a sign of various conditions, such as dehydration or certain foods you have consumed.\n\n### Microscopic Examination\n\nIn the microscopic examination, a small amount of urine is viewed under a microscope. This helps to detect elements that are not visible to the naked eye, such as:\n\n- **Red Blood Cells**: Indicate bleeding in the urinary tract.\n- [**White Blood Cells**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/leukocytes-in-urine): Suggest infection or inflammation.\n- [**Bacteria**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/bacteria-in-urine): Indicate a urinary tract infection.\n- **Crystals**: May suggest kidney stones or other conditions. This detailed examination helps pinpoint specific issues that need further investigation or immediate treatment.\n\n### Chemical Dipstick Test\n\nThe chemical dipstick test involves dipping a thin plastic strip treated with chemicals into the urine sample. The strip changes color based on the presence and concentration of certain substances, providing quick and useful information.\n\nA urine test can be used to check these substances:\n\n| **Biomarker** | **Normal Range** |\n| --- | --- |\n| [pH value](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/urine-ph) | 4.6-8 |\n| [Protein](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/protein-in-urine) | Not usually found in urine |\n| [Sugar (glucose)](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/glucose) | Not usually found in urine |\n| [Nitrite](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/nitrites-in-urine) | Not usually found in urine |\n| [Ketone](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/ketones-in-urine) | Not usually found in urine |\n| [Bilirubin](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/bilirubin) | Not usually found in urine |\n| [Urobilinogen](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/urobilinogen-in-urine) | Not usually found in urine |\n| Red blood cells (erythrocytes) | Not usually found in urine |\n| [White blood cells (leukocytes)](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/leukocytes-in-urine) | Not usually found in urine |\n\n**Note**: _Different laboratories might use varying result forms._\n\n## Test Types\n\nUrinalysis tests come in various forms, each designed to detect specific health conditions or substances in the body. Here are some common types of urinalysis tests:\n\n### Routine Urinalysis\n\nRoutine urinalysis involves examining the urine for physical, chemical, and microscopic properties. This test helps identify abnormalities that might indicate underlying health issues.\n\n### Specific Urine Tests\n\nThese tests focus on particular conditions or substances and may be considered specialized forms of urinalysis:\n\n#### Pregnancy Test\n\nA pregnancy test confirms pregnancy by detecting the **hormone human chorionic gonadotropin** ( **hCG**) in the urine. This hormone is produced by the placenta shortly after the embryo attaches to the uterine lining.\n\n#### Drug Test\n\nDrug tests identify the **presence of drugs or their metabolites in the urine**. These tests are commonly used in employment screenings, sports, and medical settings to check for illegal substances or misuse of prescription medications.\n\n#### Glucose Test\n\nA glucose test checks for the **presence of glucose in the urine**. High glucose levels can be a marker for diabetes, indicating that the body is not effectively managing blood sugar levels.\n\n#### Protein and Microalbumin Test\n\nThe protein and microalbumin test measures the **amount of protein in the urine**. Elevated levels can indicate kidney issues or early kidney disease. This test is particularly important for people with diabetes or high blood pressure.\n\n#### STD Urine Test\n\nAn STD urine test screens for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as **chlamydia**, **gonorrhea**, and **trichomoniasis**. Early detection and treatment of STIs are crucial to prevent complications and spread.\n\n#### Urine Culture\n\nA urine culture identifies bacteria causing urinary tract infections ( **UTIs**). The test involves growing bacteria from the urine sample in a lab to determine the type and most effective treatment.\n\n#### Alcohol Urine Test\n\nAn alcohol urine test detects markers for alcohol consumption, including **ethyl glucuronide (EtG)** and **ethyl sulfate (EtS)**. These markers can indicate recent alcohol intake even after the alcohol has been metabolized.\n\n### Related Urine Tests\n\nThese tests, while involving urine, are often categorized separately due to their specific protocols or combination with other testing methods:\n\n#### Mycotoxin Urine Test\n\nA mycotoxin urine test detects mycotoxins, which are **toxins produced by certain molds**. This test helps identify mold exposure and related health issues, such as respiratory problems and chronic fatigue.\n\n#### 24-Hour Urine Collection\n\nThis test involves collecting all urine produced in a 24-hour period. It is used to measure substances that are released in varying amounts throughout the day, such as **creatinine**, **protein**, and **certain hormones**. This test provides a more accurate picture of kidney function and overall metabolic processes.\n\n#### Creatinine Clearance Test\n\nA creatinine clearance test measures how well the kidneys are removing creatinine from the blood. It involves both a **blood test** and a **24-hour urine collection**. This test helps assess kidney function and can detect early signs of kidney damage.\n\n#### Urine Cytology\n\nUrine cytology examines urine under a microscope to **look for abnormal cells**. This test can help diagnose urinary tract cancers, such as **bladder cancer**. It is typically ordered if there is blood in the urine or other signs of cancer.\n\n## How to Prepare for a Urinalysis\n\nProper preparation for a urinalysis can ensure accurate results. Here are some tips on how to prepare:\n\n### Dietary Considerations\n\nCertain foods can discolor urine and affect the test results. For example, beets, blackberries, and food dyes can change the color of your urine. To avoid misleading results, consider avoiding these foods before the test.\n\n### Informing the Doctor About Medications and Supplements\n\n**Medications**, **vitamins**, and **supplements** can also affect urinalysis results. It’s important to inform your doctor about all the substances you are taking. They might advise you to temporarily stop taking certain medications before the test.\n\n### Specific Instructions if Menstruating\n\nIf you are [menstruating](https://docus.ai/tags/menstruation), let your doctor know before the test. Menstrual blood can contaminate the urine sample and affect the results. Your doctor may recommend postponing the test until after your period.\n\n### Should It Be Morning Urine?\n\nFor certain tests, it is beneficial to collect the first urine of the morning. Morning urine is typically more concentrated, which can help in detecting specific substances more effectively. Your doctor will advise if this is necessary for your particular test.\n\n### Clean Catch Method for Urine Sample Collection\n\nThe clean catch method helps prevent contamination of the urine sample. Here’s how to do it:\n\n1. Wash your hands thoroughly.\n2. Clean the area around the urinary opening with a sterile wipe.\n3. Start urinating into the toilet.\n4. Stop midstream and collect the urine in the provided container.\n5. Finish urinating into the toilet.\n\nFollowing these steps helps ensure that the urine sample is as clean as possible, leading to more accurate test results.\n\n## Understanding Urinalysis Results\n\nInterpreting urinalysis results can be complex, and it's crucial to consult with your healthcare provider to fully understand what the results mean for your health.\n\nAfter your urinalysis, your healthcare provider will review the results with you. They will explain what the findings mean and how they relate to your overall health. It’s important to ask questions and discuss any concerns you may have.
