They help detect nutrient imbalances that can lead to **fatigue**, **immune issues**, or other health problems. Regular testing is key to maintaining overall well-being.\n\nContents\n\n- [What are Nutritional Tests?](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/nutritional-tests#what-are-nutritional-tests)\n- [When are Nutritional Tests Recommended?](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/nutritional-tests#when-are-nutritional-tests-recommended)\n- [Components of Nutritional Tests](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/nutritional-tests#components-of-nutritional-tests)\n- [How is a Nutritional Test Conducted?](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/nutritional-tests#how-is-a-nutritional-test-conducted)\n- [How to Prepare for a Nutritional Test](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/nutritional-tests#how-to-prepare-for-a-nutritional-test)\n- [Normal Levels](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/nutritional-tests#normal-levels)\n- [Results Interpretation](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/nutritional-tests#results-interpretation)\n\n## What are Nutritional Tests?\n\nNutritional tests check the levels of **essential vitamins**, **minerals**, and **nutrients** in the body. They focus on nutrients like **Vitamin D**, [**iron**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/iron), and **omega-3 fatty acids**.\n\nStandard [blood tests](https://docus.ai/glossary/lab-test-types/blood-test-overview) measure general health indicators, such as [cholesterol](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/cholesterol) and [glucose](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/glucose). In comparison, nutritional tests provide a closer look at specific nutrient levels.\n\nThey can reveal deficiencies or excesses that standard tests might miss. This deeper insight helps create a personalized approach to diet and overall well-being.\n\n![Docus AI Symptom Checker](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdark-assistant.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## Your Personal AI Doctor\n\nCustomize your AI Doctor to ask any health-related questions.

It helps prevent conditions like **anemia**, **bone loss**, or **poor immune function**.\n\nWith this information, you can make informed choices about diet and supplements. These tests help you achieve better overall well-being and health optimization.\n\n## Components of Nutritional Tests\n\nA nutritional test measures key vitamins, minerals, and other essential components. Here are the main types of nutrients that these tests analyze:\n\n### Vitamins\n\nVitamins are crucial for energy, immunity, and overall body function. A nutrient panel often measures levels of:\n\n- **B12:** Supports nerve function and red blood cell production.\n\n- **[Vitamin D](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/vitamin-d):** Maintains bone health and immune function.\n\n- **[Vitamin C](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/vitamin-c):** Boosts immune health and aids in collagen production.\n\n### Minerals\n\nMinerals help maintain strong bones, muscle function, and overall cellular health. Common minerals tested include:\n\n- [**Iron**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/iron) **:** Helps transport oxygen throughout the body.\n\n- **[Magnesium](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/magnesium):** Supports muscle and nerve function.\n\n- **[Zinc](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/zinc):** Strengthens the immune system.\n\n- [**Calcium**](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/calcium) **:** Maintains strong bones and teeth.\n\n### Essential Fatty Acids\n\nEssential fatty acids are vital for heart health and reducing inflammation. A nutritional test may check for:\n\n- **Omega-3:** Reduces inflammation and supports heart health.\n\n\n### Amino Acids\n\nAmino acids are the building blocks of proteins, essential for muscle growth and tissue repair. Tests can show if your body has enough of these important nutrients.\n\n![Nutritional Tests](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocus-live-cms-storage-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduct_guide%2Fimages%2Fsections%2F2e718b86f0e6a89728fb74f4e02cd69d.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n## How is a Nutritional Test Conducted?\n\nA nutritional test can be performed either in a **clinic** or **at home**.\n\nIn a clinic, a healthcare provider draws a small blood sample from your arm, which is then sent to a lab for analysis. The lab results are typically available within a few days.\n\nAt-home **nutrient panel kits** have become more popular as a convenient alternative. These kits include instructions and tools to collect a small blood sample with a finger prick.\n\nAfter collecting the sample, you mail it to the lab in a pre-labeled package from the kit. The lab analyzes the sample, and you get your results through a secure online portal.\n\n## How to Prepare for a Nutritional Test\n\nProper preparation ensures accurate test results. Follow these recommendations before taking a nutrient panel test:\n\n- Some tests require fasting for **8-12 hours** before the blood draw. This prevents food from affecting your nutrient levels.\n- Morning is often the best time to take the test, especially if fasting is needed. This helps ensure consistent results.\n- Avoid high-fat foods or certain supplements for at least **24 hours** before testing. Your healthcare provider may give specific instructions based on your situation.\n- Proper hydration ensures a smoother testing process.\n- Always follow any additional instructions from your healthcare provider. This may include stopping certain medications or supplements temporarily.\n\n## Normal Levels\n\nEach nutrient has a normal range that reflects healthy levels. It is important to stay within this range to maintain good health.\n\n| Nutrient | Normal Range |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Vitamin B12](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/vitamin-b12) | 160-950 pg/mL |\n| Vitamin D | 20-100 ng/mL |\n| Vitamin C | 0.6-2 mg/dL |\n| Iron | Men: 75–150 mcg/dL<br> Women: 60–140 mcg/dL |\n| Magnesium | 1.7-2.2 mg/dL |\n| Zinc | 0.66-1.10 mcg/mL |\n| Calcium | 8.5-10.2 mg/dL |\n| Omega-3 Fatty Acids | 8-11% of total fatty acids |\n| Amino Acids | Varies by specific amino acid |\n\n**Note** _: The units of measurement and the normal ranges can differ depending on the laboratory and the specific methods used._\n\n![Lab Test Interpretation](https://docus.ai/_next/image?url=%2Fhome%2Fservices%2Fhome_lab_tests.png&w=3840&q=100)\n\n#### Lab Test Interpretation\n\nUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.\n\n[Learn More](https://docus.ai/lab-test-interpretation)\n\n## Results Interpretation\n\nWhen levels of nutrients fall outside the normal range, they can cause deficiencies or excesses. Both can have a significant impact on your body.\n\n| Nutrient | Effects of Deficiency | Effects of Excess |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [Vitamin B12](https://docus.ai/glossary/biomarkers/vitamin-b12) | Fatigue<br> Nerve damage | Rare, possible kidney issues |\n| Vitamin D | Weak bones<br> Immune dysfunction | Toxicity<br> Kidney damage |\n| Vitamin C | Weak immune system<br> Slow healing | Diarrhea<br> Stomach cramps |\n| Iron | Anemia<br> Fatigue | Organ damage<br> Joint pain |\n| Magnesium | Muscle cramps,<br> Weakness | Diarrhea<br> Low blood pressure |\n| Zinc | Weak immune function<br> Slow healing | Nausea,<br> Diarrhea<br> Headaches |\n| Calcium | Weak bones<br> Muscle cramps | Kidney stones,<br> Heart problems |\n| Omega-3 Fatty Acids | Risk of heart disease | Rare, but possible bleeding in excess |\n| Amino Acids | Muscle loss<br> Weakness | Rare, but excess protein may stress kidneys |\n\nA healthcare provider will interpret your results and explain any imbalances. If necessary, they may recommend dietary changes or prescribe supplements to correct deficiencies or excesses.\n\n#### Sources\n\nThis article was written by doctors from the Docus Medical Research team and reviewed by leading gastroenterology and endocrinology experts.
