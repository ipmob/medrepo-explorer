# Technical Problem Statements for Medical Test Result Standardization

## 1. Test Name Standardization
**Problem**: Medical test names exhibit significant variation across laboratories due to:
- Different terminology used by different labs
- OCR errors in digitized reports
- Spelling variations and inconsistencies

**Technical Challenge**: Developing a semantic similarity algorithm that can:
- Accurately match test names beyond simple string similarity
- Distinguish between semantically different tests with similar names (e.g., Vitamin D2 vs D3)
- Handle OCR errors and spelling variations while maintaining semantic accuracy

## 2. LOINC Code Mapping
**Problem**: Mapping test names to standardized LOINC (Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes) identifiers requires contextual information beyond the test name itself:
- Specimen type (e.g., serum vs. urine)
- Sample collection method (e.g., spot sample vs. 24-hour collection)
- Measurement units and reporting format
- Testing methodology

**Technical Challenge**: Creating a system that can:
- Extract contextual information from various parts of lab reports
- Infer missing contextual details when not explicitly stated
- Apply the correct LOINC mapping based on multiple parameters
- Handle ambiguity when contextual information is incomplete

## 3. Unit Normalization
**Problem**: Test values are reported in diverse units with varying scales and notations:
- Different scale factors (e.g., 10³/μL vs 10⁵/μL)
- Different unit representations (e.g., lakh/μL)
- Inconsistent notation across laboratories

**Technical Challenge**: Implementing a unit conversion system that can:
- Recognize various unit representations
- Determine the appropriate conversion factors
- Standardize all values to a common scale
- Handle edge cases and unusual unit formats
